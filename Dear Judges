 
Dear Judges 

I hope you have as much fun using QChat as much as me and Oren had fun making it!

The amount of weird internet rabbot hole's we had to enter in order to find and scrap misinformation, to train the model, and the crazy conspiracies we encountered were absolutely hilarious!
Youtube comments, reddit, strange blogs, religious cult forums, no stone would be left unturned. Man this was one hell of an adventure!
Let's just say that this project was an experience that me and Oren will never forget. 

And we thank you for that! :D

I don't want to get too philosophical either but we learned how damaging misinformation can be, and how difficult it can be to 
moderate content on platforms. I was able to see how redundancies occurred because the misinformation was being spread from one source, and then it created a ripple effect.
Then their is also the Streisand effect, which also makes content moderation extremely difficult.

Either way enough of my philosophical rant from me and Oren Welcome to QChat!

ps: If your wondering what the 'Q' in QChat stands for -- it stands for Quarantine.     :)
