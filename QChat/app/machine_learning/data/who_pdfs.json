publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on  the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its  frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  [1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).    Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always  reflect the exact difference between yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed  COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different  data cutoff times are to be expected.      New countries/territories/areas are shown in red.          \fFigure 1. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 29 March 2020            STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                     \fPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here and courses in additional national  languages here.  Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:    o  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in   Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese,  Serbian and Turkish);   o  Clinical care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian   and Vietnamese);    o  Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in Chinese, English, French,   o   Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);   Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French,  Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Serbian); and   o  COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country   preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.             \fRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case  A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,  shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of  COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.  OR   B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19   case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;  OR   C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that  fully explains the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.   a.   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.   B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.   OR      Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.   \u2022  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.          Definition of contact  A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days   \fafter the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:   1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;  2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal   protective equipment1;  OR   4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.     Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days  after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.                                                    1 World Health Organization.

To date, WHO has  shipped almost 2 million individual items of PPE to 74 countries and is  preparing to send a similar amount to a further 60 countries. The Director- General\u2019s opening remarks at the media briefing can be found here.     \u2022  Today, WHO published the first edition of the practical manual to set up and   manage a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) treatment centre and a  SARI screening facility in health-care facilities. The document has been  developed to meet the operational needs emerging with the COVID-19  pandemic. For more details, please see the document here.       Figure 1.

Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  [1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).    Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always  reflect the exact difference between yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed  COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different  data cutoff times are to be expected.              \fFigure 1. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 28 March 2020            STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                     \fPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here and courses in additional national  languages here.  Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:    o  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in   Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese,  Serbian and Turkish);   o  Clinical care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian   and Vietnamese);    o  Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in Chinese, English, French,   o   Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);   Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French,  Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Serbian); and   o  COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country   preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.             \fRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case  A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,  shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of  COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.  OR   B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19   case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;  OR   C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that  fully explains the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.   a.   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.   B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.   OR      Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.   \u2022  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.          Definition of contact  A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days   \fafter the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:   1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;  2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal   protective equipment1;  OR   4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.     Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days  after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.                                                    1 World Health Organization.

More information can be found on the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office  site here.    \u2022  OpenWHO celebrates 1 million enrollments today. Seventy percent of the  total enrollments are on COVID-19 resources, reflecting the critical role the  platform is playing in supporting the response to the pandemic. On 25 March,  a new course was launched describing how to design and operate treatment  centres for the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 resources are hosted on two  learning channels: one for courses in official WHO languages here and a  second for courses in additional national languages here.   \u2022  The number of countries implementing additional health measures that   significantly interfere with international traffic has increased since the  declaration of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international  concern. The United Nations World Tourism Organization launched a Crisis  Committee to review the impact of the outbreak on the aviation, shipping and  tourism sectors and propose innovative solutions for recovery.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 27 March 2020            STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                     \fPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here and courses in additional national  languages here.  Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:    o  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in   Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese,  Serbian and Turkish);   o  Clinical care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian   and Vietnamese);    o  Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in Chinese, English, French,   o   Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);   Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French,  Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Serbian); and   o  COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country   preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.             \fRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case  A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,  shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of  COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.  OR   B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19   case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;  OR   C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that  fully explains the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.   a.   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.   B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.   OR      Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.   \u2022  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.          Definition of contact  A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days   \fafter the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:   1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;  2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal   protective equipment1;  OR   4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.     Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days  after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.                                                    1 World Health Organization.

More information can be found here.     \u2022  WHO published the COVID-19: Operational guidance for maintaining essential   health services during an outbreak and the Handbook for public health  capacity-building at ground crossings and cross-border collaboration on 25  March 2020. All guidance documents can be found here.    \u2022   In line with current evidence, WHO maintains the recommendations of  droplet and contact precautions for healthcare workers caring for COVID-19  patients. For those performing aerosol generating procedures, WHO  recommends airborne and contact precautions. The use of medical masks, eye  protection, gloves and gown are required for direct patient care; respirator  masks are specifically required for aerosol generating procedures.

In this experimental study, aerosols were generated using a three-jet Collison nebulizer and  fed into a Goldberg drum under controlled laboratory conditions. This is a high-powered machine that does not  reflect normal human coughing or sneezing nor does it reflect aerosol generating procedures in clinical settings.  Furthermore, the findings do not bring new evidence on airborne transmission as aerosolization with particles  potentially containing the virus was already known as a possibility during procedures generating aerosols.     In all other contexts, available evidence indicates that COVID-19 virus is transmitted during close contact through  respiratory droplets (such as coughing) and by fomites.2-8  The virus can spread directly from person to person when  a COVID-19 case coughs or exhales producing droplets that reach the nose, mouth or eyes of another person.  Alternatively, as the droplets are too heavy to be airborne, they land on objects and surfaces surrounding the  person. Other people become infected with COVID-19 by touching these contaminated objects or surfaces, then  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. According to the currently available evidence, transmission through smaller  droplet nuclei (airborne transmission) that propagate through air at distances longer than 1 meter is limited to  aerosol generating procedures during clinical care of COVID-19 patients.    As such, WHO continues to recommend that everyone performs hand hygiene frequently, follows respiratory  etiquette recommendations and regularly clean and disinfect surfaces. WHO also continues to recommend the  importance of maintaining physical distances and avoiding people with fever or respiratory symptoms. These  preventive measures will limit viral transmission.      Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, and in alignment with available evidence, WHO maintains the  recommendation, in the context of droplet and contact precautions for the use of medical masks for regular care of  COVID-19 patients and respirators (N95, FFP2 or FFP3) for circumstances and settings where aerosol generating  procedures are performed.9      References   1.  van Doremalen N, Morris D, Bushmaker T et al.

publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on  the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its  frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  [1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).    Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always  reflect the exact difference between yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed  COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different  data cutoff times are to be expected.    New countries/territories/areas are shown in red.            \fFigure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 26 March 2020            STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                     \fPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here and courses in additional national  languages here.  Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:    o  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in   Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese,  Serbian and Turkish);   o  Clinical care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian   and Vietnamese);    o  Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in Chinese, English, French,   o   Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);   Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French,  Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Serbian); and   o  COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country   preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.             \fRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case  A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,  shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of  COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.  OR   B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19   case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;  OR   C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that  fully explains the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.   a.   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.   B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.   OR      Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.   \u2022  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.          Definition of contact  A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days   \fafter the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:   1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;  2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal   protective equipment1;  OR   4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.     Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days  after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.                                                    1 World Health Organization.

Courses in additional languages  can be found here.    \u2022  As the world tackles the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to ensure that  essential health services and operations continue to be available to protect  the lives of people with malaria, TB and other diseases or health conditions.  More information can be found here and here.    \u2022  EPI-WIN, WHO\u2019s information network for epidemics, makes easy-to-  understand advice and information available on a dedicated page on the WHO  website. EPI-WIN is also providing employers and workers with timely  information through regular calls. More information can be found on the web  here and in Subject in Focus.    Figure 1.

EPI-WIN\u2019s two-way  communication network addresses key information needs while rebutting misinformation and fighting infodemics,  which spread misinformation, create confusion and distrust among people and hamper an effective response.    The EPI-WIN website  is aimed at a wide range of audiences including    \u2022  individuals and communities  \u2022  the health sector,   \u2022  countries,   \u2022  the travel and tourism sector,   \u2022  faith-based organizations and faith leaders,   \u2022  large event organizers, and  \u2022  employers and employees.     Of the world\u2019s population of around 8 billion, over 3 billion are in paid employment. National and international trade  unions represent the rights and welfare of workers not only in relation to employment but also often in relation to  their families and communities and are regarded as trusted sources of information and advice by their members.       EPI-WIN is engaging closely with employers and workers through different entities and organizations that serve as  amplifiers with the capacity to reach vast numbers of people with life-saving information and guidance. The  International Organization of Employers alone reaches 50 million businesses in 150 countries.  Among several other  entities and organizations, EPI-WIN has strong links with trade unions through the International Labour Organization  (ILO)\u2019s the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Activities (ACTRAV), the International Trade Union Confederation and the global  sectoral unions, reaching over 210 million workers and their families in 163 countries.      To best respond to the need for timely information of these different audiences, EPI-WIN conducts regular calls with  the different sectors. On March 23rd, WHO and the International Occupational Medicine Society Collaboration  (IOMSC) conducted a webinar on \u201cOccupational Health Measures in the Preparedness and Response to COVID19 in  the Workplace.\u201d Approximately 225 participants registered for the webinar including IOMSC Occupational Medical  Society members as well as other Occupational Medical Society physician leaders from around the world. Participant  questions were notably around the themes of: workplace transmission of COVID-19; the use of masks and other  personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare and other public-facing workers; the use of rapid tests for COVID- 19 to screen workers in workplaces; \u201cReturn to Work\u201d guidance; and mental health and psychosocial impacts in  workplaces, in particular health facilities.     Two additional webinars are scheduled for Thursday, 26 March the first with the European Federation of Public  Service Unions (EPSU), representing 8 million workers, and the second a videoconference with the International  Organization of Employers (IOE): \u201cSummit on the collaboration of the private sector with health systems in  emergency situations.\u201d    Employers and employees have a crucial role to play in stopping COVID-19 and reducing the impact of the  disease on society. A key area of EPI-WIN\u2019s work focuses on how to create a COVID-safe workplace and prevent  transmission of the disease between employees through the following measures:    Preventing transmission of COVID-19 between employees  Implement remote work practices (tele-working)     \u2022  \u2022  Social distancing measures in the workplace when on-site presence is required (at least 1 metre)   \fLimit travel beyond non-essential travel    \u2022  Hold fewer in- person meetings   \u2022  Restrict the number of visitors entering the workplace   \u2022  \u2022  Ensure people with symptoms or with family members with symptoms self-quarantine for 14 days    \u2022   Check the body temperature of employees daily so that employees with fever don\u2019t come to work  \u2022  Facilitate access to reliable information for employees to promote understanding of the disease and its   symptoms and the personal preventative measures (respiratory etiquette, hand washing, self-isolation if  sick)   \u2022  Check and follow the advice from the authorities in the community before holding a meeting or event;   follow all necessary precautions, protective and self-isolation measures, should a meeting go ahead.     Maintain a safe and healthy work environment   \u2022  Develop a business continuity plan   \u2022  Develop a contingency and business continuity plan for an outbreak in the communities where your business   operates and for when your employees return to work during or after COVID-19 according to national and  local health authorities.    \u2022  Promote regular and thorough hand washing by employees, contractors and customers, as well as good   respiratory hygiene.   \u2022  Clean workspaces frequently with disinfectant including high risk areas/space (e.g. door handle, reception   counter, elevators, disinfection of working stations of COVID-19 cases)   \u2022  Provide alcohol-based gel or washing hands stations  \u2022  Establish a reporting system for any cases among employees  \u2022  Establish a system to quarantine close contacts of a suspect or confirmed case among the employees  \u2022  Ensure good ventilation   \u2022  Develop a food delivery system that reduces contacts with food deliverers and avoid employee lines   \u2022  Ensure psycho-social support of employees during the pandemic. Incorporate mental health resources into  human resources policies. Your employees may be suffering from emotional distress during this period; and  may also suffer distress when experiencing changes like returning to work.              \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  [1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).    Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always  reflect the exact difference between yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed  COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different  data cutoff times are to be expected.    New countries/territories/areas are shown in red.    Erratum: Global total number of cases and deaths have been revised.        \fFigure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 25 March 2020          STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                     \fPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here and courses in additional national  languages here.  Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:    o  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in   Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese,  Serbian and Turkish);   o  Clinical care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian   and Vietnamese);    o  Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in Chinese, English, French,   o   Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);   Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French,  Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Serbian); and   o  COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country   preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.             \fRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case  A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,  shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of  COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.  OR   B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19   case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;  OR   C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that  fully explains the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.   a.   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.   B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.   OR      Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.   \u2022  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.          Definition of contact  A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days   \fafter the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:   1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;  2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal   protective equipment1;  OR   4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.     Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days  after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.                                                    1 World Health Organization.

This is to ensure that supplies are allocated effectively and equitably in the  places where they are needed the most.     WHO is also working with the World Bank to develop demand modeling from a country-based perspective. This will  allow the sharing and support of technical guidance and allocation mechanisms and ensure that critical supplies are  distributed with most impact.      The planning effort will support the mapping of scenarios as well as what is needed for stocks and procurement.  With the engagement of the World Bank, the PSCN seeks to bring together the overview of the market\u2019s capability to  provide and distribute the necessary supplies, WHO demand forecasting and the necessary financial and political  support to fight COVID-19.    Representatives from both WFP and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)  have joined the WHO team at HQ to establish the Supply Chain Coordination Cell (SCCC). The objectives of the SCCC  are to:     \u2022  Establish a COVID-19 supply chain working group to deepen inter-agency collaboration with the aim of   minimizing disruptions to current humanitarian operations, while increasing efficiency and coherence of the  COVID-19 response.   \u2022  Provide a centralized voice through the collection and dissemination of information to the UN Crisis   Management Team (UNCMT), other relevant forums, as well as the wider humanitarian community, to  support strategic guidance, operational decision-making, and overall monitoring.   \u2022  Foster the creation of regional and country level coordination mechanisms aimed at implementing efforts,   while maintaining the overall coordination of the response.   \u2022  Create a smaller joint procurement group of medical equipment buying agencies.      WHO and its partners are constantly working to strengthen the chains of essential COVID-19 supplies.  As global  demand rises, WHO and its partners aim to ensure that those areas most at need receive as much assistance as  much as possible.        \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on  the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its  frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  [1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).    Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always  reflect the exact difference between yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed  COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different  data cutoff times are to be expected.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 24 March 2020          STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                     \fPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Persian, Portuguese,  Serbian, and Turkish); Clinical Care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian,  and Vietnamese); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French,  Russian, Indonesian, and Portuguese); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)  (available in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Serbian);  and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country  preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.             \fRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case  A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,  shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of  COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.  OR   B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19   case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;  OR   C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that  fully explains the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.   a.   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.   B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.   OR      Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.   \u2022  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.          Definition of contact  A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days   \fafter the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:   1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;  2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal   protective equipment1;  OR   4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.     Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days  after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.                                                    1 World Health Organization.

publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on  the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its  frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  ^ Data for the European Region is obtained from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)   [1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).    Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always  reflect the exact difference between yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed  COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different  data cutoff times are to be expected.    New countries/territories/areas are shown in red.    Erratum: Transmission classification has been revised for Jordan and total deaths have been revised for Croatia.            \fFigure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 23 March 2020         STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                       \fPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Persian, Portuguese,  Serbian, and Turkish); Clinical Care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian,  and Vietnamese); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French,  Russian, Indonesian, and Portuguese); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)  (available in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Serbian);  and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country  preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.             \fRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case  A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,  shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of  COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.  OR   B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19   case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;  OR   C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that  fully explains the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.   a.   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.   B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.   OR      Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.   \u2022  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.          Definition of contact  A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days   \fafter the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:   1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;  2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal   protective equipment1;  OR   4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.     Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days  after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.                                                    1 World Health Organization.

and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on  the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its  frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  ^ Data for the European Region is obtained from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)   \u2020\u2020Including 24 (0 new) cases from Kosovo[1]  [1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).    Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always  reflect the exact difference between yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed  COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different  data cutoff times are to be expected.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 21 March 2020      Note that the apparent decrease in number of cases may be due to a reporting bias during the weekend.                  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.          \fPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Persian, Portuguese,  Serbian, and Turkish); Clinical Care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian,  and Vietnamese); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French,  Russian, Indonesian, and Portuguese); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)  (available in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Serbian);  and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country  preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.             \fRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case  A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,  shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of  COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.  OR   B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19   case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;  OR   C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that  fully explains the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.   a.   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.   B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.   OR      Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.   \u2022  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.          Definition of contact  A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days   \fafter the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:   1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;  2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal   protective equipment1;  OR   4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.     Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days  after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.                                                    1 World Health Organization.

\u2020The designations employed and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on  the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its  frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.  Terms:          -   -  -  -  -   Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by  increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories).  Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  ^ Data for the European Region is obtained from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)   \u2020\u2020Including 24 (3 new) cases from Kosovo[1]  [1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).    Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always  reflect the exact difference between yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed  COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different  data cutoff times are to be expected.    New countries/territories/areas are shown in red.    Erratum: Transmission classification has been revised for Cuba and Haiti and number of deaths have been revised for Croatia.       Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 20 March 2020               \f   STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.         PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Persian, Portuguese,  Serbian, and Turkish); Clinical Care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian,   \fand Vietnamese); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French,  Russian, Indonesian, and Portuguese); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)  (available in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Serbian);  and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country  preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case  A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,  shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of  COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.  OR   B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19   case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;  OR   \fC.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that  fully explains the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.   a.   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.   B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.   OR      Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.   \u2022  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.          Definition of contact  A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days  after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:   1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;  2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal   protective equipment1;  OR   4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.     Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days  after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.                                                    1 World Health Organization.

This service  will provide the latest news and information on COVID-19, including details on  symptoms and how people can protect themselves. The Health Alert service is  now available in English and will be introduced in other languages next week.  To access it, send the word \"hi\" to the following number on WhatsApp: +41  798 931 892.     \u2022  The first vaccine trial has begun just 60 days after the genetic sequence of the  virus was shared by China. This is an incredible achievement. To ensure clear  evidence of which treatments are most effective, WHO and its partners are  organizing  a  large  international  study,  called  the  Solidarity  Trial,  in  many  countries to compare different treatments.     \u2022  WHO  and  Global  Citizen  launched  #TogetherAtHome,  a  virtual,  no-contact  concert  series  to  promote  physical  distancing  and  action  for  global  health.  Chris  Martin,  lead  singer  of  Coldplay,  kicked  it  off  earlier  this  week  with  a  performance from his home. More Solidarity Sessions are planned to promote  health,  show  support  for  people  who  are  staying  at  home  to  protect  themselves  and  others  from  COVID-19,  and  encourage  donations  to  the  COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.

It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.  Terms:    -   -  -  -  -   Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by  increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories).  Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  \u2020\u2020Including 21 (8 new) cases from Kosovo[1]  [1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 19 March 2020                   \fSTRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.         PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Persian, Portuguese,  Serbian, and Turkish); Clinical Care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian,  and Vietnamese); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French,   \fRussian, Indonesian, and Portuguese); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)  (available in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Serbian);  and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country  preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   OR  B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-  19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;   OR   \fC.  A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease   (e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains  the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.    \u2022   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory     Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.    \u2022   Information regarding laboratory guidance can be found here.             \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                                                         Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 59   Data as reported by national authorities by 00:00 CET 19 March 2020            HIGHLIGHTS   \u2022  Seven  new  countries/territories/areas   [3],  Eastern  Mediterranean Region [1], European Region [1], and Region of the Americas  [2]) have reported cases of COVID-19.

Studies to assess these characteristics in different settings are critical to furthering our  understanding. They will also provide the robust information needed to refine forecasting models and inform public  health measures.   As such, WHO, in collaboration with technical partners, has adapted early epidemiological investigations protocols  from pandemic influenza and from MERS-CoV, to better understand these characteristics and how they may be used  to inform public health measures.    To date, five early seroepidemiological core protocols and data collection forms are available on the WHO COVID-19  Technical guidance website.   All protocols propose a standardized methodology to allow data and biological samples to be systematically collected,  taking into consideration local setting and outbreak characteristics, and shared rapidly in a format that can be easily  aggregated, tabulated and analyzed across many different settings globally.   Study Protocol  The First Few COVID-19  cases and contacts  transmission investigation  protocol (FFX)   Households transmission  of COVID-19 investigation  protocol   Assessment of COVID-19  risk factors among Health  workers protocol   Surface sampling of  COVID-19 for health care  professionals   Population based  serologic survey         Objectives  To provide descriptions and/or estimates of the:   \u2022  \u2022   \u2022  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection and course of associated disease  secondary infection rate (SIR) and secondary clinical attack rate of COVID-19  infection among close contacts (overall, and by key factors such as setting, age  and sex, for various end-points)  serial interval of COVID-19 infection  symptomatic proportion of COVID-19 cases (through contact tracing and  laboratory testing); and identification of possible routes of transmission  To better understand the extent of transmission within a household by estimating  the secondary infection rate for household contacts at an individual level, and  factors associated with any variation in the secondary infection risk  To characterize secondary cases including the range of clinical presentation, risk  factors for infection, and the extent and fraction of asymptomatic infections  To characterize serologic response following confirmed COVID-19 infection   To better understand the extent of human-to-human transmission among health  care workers, by estimating the secondary infection rate for health care worker  contacts at an individual level  To characterize the range of clinical presentation of infection and the risk factors  for infection among health care workers  To evaluate effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures among  health care workers  To assess the extent and persistence of surface contamination with COVID-19  virus  To identify environmental surfaces which may play a role in onwards transmission  of COVID-19 infection  To estimate age-specific seroprevalence    The latest protocol, the Population-based age-stratified seroepidemiological investigation protocol for COVID-19  virus infection, is intended to provide key epidemiological and serologic characteristics of COVID-19 virus in the  general population. Specifically, data from this protocol will provide critical information about the extent of infection  (as measured by the presence of antibodies in study subjects) in the general population, age-specific infection   \fcumulative incidence, and the fraction of people with asymptomatic or subclinical infection.   The results of these investigations, whether individually or pooled across study sites/countries, will allow further  understanding and provide robust estimates of key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the  COVID-19 virus, including:   \u2022  Key epidemiological parameters, such as: secondary infection rate and secondary clinical attack rate of   COVID-19 infection among close contacts, asymptomatic fraction of infection, serial interval and incubation  period of COVID-19, the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 infection   Impact of infection prevention and control measures in health care settings   \u2022  Clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection and course of associated disease  \u2022  Risk factors for transmission and infection, and identification of possible routes of transmission  \u2022  \u2022  Serological response following symptomatic COVID-19 infection  \u2022  Age-stratified seroprevalence of antibodies against COVID-19 virus   \u2022  Cumulative incidence of infection, including extent of age-specific infection   \u2022  \u2022  Viral load and shedding profiles  \u2022  Viral persistence on surfaces   Infection and disease-severity ratios (case-hospitalization ratio [CHR] and case-fatality ratio [CFR])   To date, 13 countries across five of the six WHO regions, including both high-income and low-and middle-income  countries, have begun to implement at least one of the early investigation protocols. A further 18 countries have  signaled their intention to implement one of the protocols. WHO will continue to support countries in their  epidemiological investigations through the provision of clear and comprehensive protocols.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   \f** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  \u2020\u2020Including 13 cases from Kosovo[1]  [1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).    Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always  reflect the exact difference between yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed  COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different  data cutoff times are to be expected.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 19 March 2020                   \fSTRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.               PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel   \fcoronaviruses (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Persian, Serbian, and  Turkish); Clinical Care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, and  Vietnamese); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French,  Russian, Indonesian, and Portuguese); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)  (available in English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Serbian); and  COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness  and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   OR   \fB.

The RCCE guidance is a tool to support national health authorities, responders and other partners to develop,  implement and monitor action plans for communicating effectively with the public and engaging with communities,  local partners and other stakeholders.      The tool includes a 7-step guidance process, which includes: collecting data and making assessments; developing  coordination mechanisms; defining and prioritizing key objectives; identifying target audiences and key influencers;  developing a RCCE strategy that fits into the country\u2019s response strategy; implementing the plan with partners and  engaging the community; and developing a monitoring plan for evaluation purposes. The RCCE Action Plan Guidance  has a planning template and practical annexes to assist with the exercise.    It allows countries and communities to:     \u2022  Adapt the elements according to country needs and the local situation.   \u2022  Revise plans according to the evolution of the situation.   \u2022  Coordinate and plan together with authorities and partners.   \u2022  Proactively communicate and promote a two-way dialogue with communities, the public and other   stakeholders.   \u2022  Understand risk perceptions, behaviours and existing barriers, specific needs, knowledge gaps, and provide   the identified communities/groups with accurate information tailored to their circumstances.    \u2022  Reduce stigma. See WHO\u2019s Guide to preventing and addressing social stigma   \u2022  Conduct early and ongoing assessments to identify essential information about at-risk populations and other  stakeholders (i.e. their perception, knowledge, preferred and accessible communication channels, or existing  barriers that prevent people to uptake the promoted behaviors).    \u2022  Ensure that all people at-risk of acquiring COVID-19 are identified, reached and involved.      Risk Communication and Community Engagement is an essential component of health emergency preparedness and  response. This Action Plan Guidance for COVID-19 provides a strategy and tool that helps to prepare and protect  individuals, families and the public\u2019s health during early response to COVID-19.                 \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  \u2020\u2020Including 13 (8 new) cases from Kosovo[1]  [1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).    Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always  reflect the exact difference between yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s totals.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 18 March 2020          STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                         \fPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Persian, Serbian, and  Turkish); Clinical Care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, and  Vietnamese); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French,  Russian, Indonesian, and Portuguese); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)  (available in English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Serbian); and  COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness  and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your   \frisks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.

In a global world with hyperconnected international travel and transport, points of entry (PoEs)\u2013 airports, ports and  ground crossings \u2013 can play a key role in the international spread of diseases through travellers, conveyances and  goods. The travel and transport sectors are indispensable actors in public health emergency preparedness and  response actions related to PoEs.    WHO has published three joint statements to remind all stakeholders of the importance of following International  Health Regulations and guidance, existing regulations of partner organizations, and the need for cross-sector  collaboration. The joint statements were released respectively, with the International Maritime Organization (IMO),  the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).    With input from IMO, ICAO, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and UNWTO as well as major industry  associations, WHO has produced and continues to develop comprehensive COVID-19 technical guidance on maritime  and aviation traffic and ground crossings. These include:   \u2022  Operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases and outbreaks on board ships (Interim guidance);  \u2022  Management of ill travellers at Points of Entry \u2013 international airports, seaports and ground crossings \u2013 in   the context of COVID-19 outbreak;   \u2022  Public health preparedness and response for aviation sector;  \u2022  Operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases/outbreak on board ships; and the  \u2022  Handbook for the management of public health events on board ships.     Additionally, guidance on operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases and outbreak in aviation, scaling  up preparedness for COVID-19 at ground crossings, and managing COVID-19 cases and outbreaks in hotels and other  travel and tourism accommodations are under development and will be available soon.     WHO also regularly updates travel advice to support emergency preparedness, which is available here. ICAO is also  publishing a dedicated website with specific resources, and guidance for airlines industries and national authorities.  Similarly, IMO and UNWTO host dedicated websites with resources and guidance for their members and  stakeholders.                 \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19, by date of report and WHO region through 17 March 2020          STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                         \fPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Persian, Serbian, and  Turkish); Clinical Care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, and  Vietnamese); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French,  Russian, Indonesian, and Portuguese); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)  (available in English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Serbian); and  COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness  and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your   \frisks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   OR  B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-  19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;   OR  C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease   (e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains  the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.    \u2022   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory     Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.    \u2022   Information regarding laboratory guidance can be found here.             \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "             Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 56   Data as reported by national authorities by 10 AM CET 16 March 2020            HIGHLIGHTS      \u2022  Four new countries/territories/areas (African Region [2], European Region [1]  and Region of the Americas [1]) in have reported cases of COVID-19 in the past  24 hours.     \u2022  The total number of cases and deaths outside China has overtaken the total  number of cases in China.

To strengthen day-to-day operations, key agencies are embedded in the global team, including UNICEF, the United  Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the International Organization for Migration (IOM),  and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The major partner coordination  mechanisms are the Emergency Medical Team (EMT) Initiative; the Global Health Cluster (GHC); and the Global  Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), which includes technical agencies, major NGOs, including M\u00e9decins  Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) International, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the IFRC, and other  international organizations.    The core elements of health operations include clinical care and management, laboratory capacity strengthening,  surveillance, case and contact tracing, infection prevention and control, risk communications and community  engagement. These core elements are supported by technical networks worldwide, which draw on and support  capacities in GOARN, GHC, and EMTs.  In the area of risk communications and community engagement, IFRC, UNICEF  and WHO have established a dedicated tripartite group to scale up and implement activities globally.     In response to the call from WHO, GOARN partners have mobilized international technical assistance to support  preparedness and response missions at country request, and to also support capacity in WHO regions and  headquarters in Geneva. In addition, Public Health England, the Indo-Pacific Health Security Centre, the Australian  government, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention have sent staff to WHO to work on COVID- 19 response in Geneva, Switzerland, Manila, Philippines and New Delhi, India.      The GHC and country Health Clusters have placed heavy emphasis on the following:    \u2022  Readiness planning  \u2022  Support to in-country key pillar leads and agencies  \u2022  Mapping partner capacity and geographical presence   \u2022  Ensuring coordination and collaboration on technical guidance and support for preparedness and response   for fragile and vulnerable populations.      The EMT initiative is working with the global and regional networks of emergency medical teams currently on the  front lines of major national outbreaks and supporting international deployment of support where needed and  requested.     A major focus of the response is on case detection and contact tracing. To support country activities, partners are  working closely on the deployment and implementation of Go.Data, an outbreak investigation tool for field data  collection during public health emergencies. Over 50 countries have requested support, and GOARN partners are  implementing a strategy for wide-scale rollout including direct country support, technical briefings, webinar/online  presentations, and comprehensive remote support.           \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO  region through 16 March 2020          STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                         \fPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian); Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory  diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel  Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and  COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response.   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19   \fand whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.

Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  1 Due to a retrospective data consolidation exercise, some numbers may not reflect the exact difference between yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s  totals.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China (n=72 469), by date of report and  WHO region through 15 March 2020         \f         STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.         PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel   \fcoronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian); Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory  diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel  Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and  COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response.   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   OR  B.

legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its  frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.  Terms:          -   -  -  -  -   Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by  increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories).  Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  Erratum: 1.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian); Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory  diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel   \fCoronavirus (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and  COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response.   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   OR  B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-  19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;   OR  C.

To  ensure  evidence-based  quality  guidance  and  prompt  response  to  global  demand,  WHO  convened  a  WHO  Health  Emergencies (WHE) Programme Ad-Hoc Experts Advisory Panel for Infection Prevention and Control, which is attended  by members of the Global Infection Prevention and Control Network (GIPCN), members of relevant institutions, and  Member  States  affected  by  COVID-19.  This  advisory  panel  supports  the  WHE  IPC  pillar  with  timely  advice  on  preparedness, readiness and response to COVID-19 based on evidence where available. They hold weekly discussions  on  the  technical  aspects  of  IPC  measures,  and  shared  experiences  across  affected  countries.  The  following  guidance/tools have been issued, in consultation with this global IPC advisory panel:      1.  Health workers exposure risk assessment and management in the context of COVID-19 virus. This tool is to   be used by health care facilities that have either cared for or admitted COVID-19 patients; it is to be  completed for all health care workers (HCW) who have been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient in a  health care facility. It helps determine the risk of COVID-19 virus infection of the HCW who have been  exposed to a COVID-19 patient and provides recommendations for appropriate management of these HCWs,  according to their infection risk.   2.  Considerations for quarantine of individuals in the context of containment for coronavirus disease (COVID-  19)  The purpose of this document is to offer guidance to Member States on quarantine measures for  individuals in the context of COVID-19. It is intended for those responsible for establishing local or national  policy for quarantine of individuals, and adherence to infection prevention and control measures in these  settings.    3.  In collaboration with WASH colleagues including UNICEF, the team has developed a briefing on water,   sanitation, hygiene and waste management for COVID-19. More information can be found here.      WHO IPC specialists are currently supporting a number of countries and have been deployed to support the response  in cooperation with IPC teams in Italy and Iraq, amongst other countries.       The  online  course  \u201cInfection  Prevention  and  Control  (IPC)  for  COVID-19\u201d  has  been  translated  into  Russian  and  Japanese. As of 13 March, 38 725 people have registered for the course. Infographics, including videos (e.g. when and  how to use a mask), are being developed on demand,     To  support  the  preparedness,  readiness  and  response  for  COVID-19,  WHO  has  convened  teleconferences  in  cooperation  with  other  partners,  including  with  Africa  CDC/CDC/ECHO  and  with  the  World  Organization of  Family  Doctors \u2013 Africa, to develop and contribute IPC information.                               \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO  region through 13 March 2020                        \f      STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.         PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian); Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory   \f   diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel  Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and  COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response.   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.

There are over 30 countries represented on this call.     The major clinical challenge reported is the severity of the disease. A recent surge in critically ill patients requiring  mechanical ventilation has strained some health systems and exhausted biomedical supplies and staff. This has  highlighted the need to better support health systems become ready for such a surge in cases. Thus, the team  alongside our logistic colleagues and partners are developing a Clinical Concept of Operations intended to guide  countries with surge decision -making, and tools to accelerate the availability of oxygen and biomedical equipment.      In addition, the Clinical unit is regularly updating other products for clinical case management:     \u2022  The updated Clinical Management Guidance for COVID-19. This will include more detailed information   about the care of patients with mild and severe illness, young children, pregnant and postpartum women  and information about breastfeeding.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China , by date of report and WHO  region through 12 March 2020         STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                             \f  PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian); Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory  diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel  Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and  COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response.   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.                        \fRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   OR  B.

However, evidence to date suggests that two groups of  people are at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 disease. These are older people (that is people over 60 years  old); and those with underlying medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory  disease, and cancer). The risk of severe disease gradually increases with age starting from around 40 years. It\u2019s  important that adults in this age range protect themselves and in turn protect others that may be more vulnerable.    WHO has issued advice for these two groups and for community support to ensure that they are protected from  COVID-19 without being isolated, stigmatized, left in a position of increased vulnerability or unable to access basic  provisions and social care. This advice covers the subject of receiving visitors, planning for supplies of medication and  food, going out safely in public and staying connected with others through phone calls or other means. It is essential  that these groups are supported by their communities during the COVID-19 outbreak. WHO emphasizes that all  people must protect themselves from COVID-19, which will also protect other.      Key advice for older adults and people with pre-existing conditions:     When you have visitors to your home, exchange \u201c1 metre greetings\u201d, like a wave, nod,  or bow.   Ask visitors and those you live with to wash their hands.  Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces in your home, especially areas that people touch  a lot.  If someone you live with isn\u2019t feeling well (especially with possible COVID-19  symptoms), limit your shared spaces.  If you become ill with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider by  telephone before visiting your healthcare facility.  Make a plan in preparation for an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community.  When you go out in public, follow the same preventative guidelines as you would at  home.  Stay up to date using information from reliable sources.                             \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China , by date of report and WHO  region through 11 March 2020         STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                             \f  PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian);  Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory  diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel  Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian);  and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and  COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response.   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.                        \fRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the  Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   OR  B.

As virus transmission shifts to other countries, measures are currently being implemented against countries other  than China (figure 1).  The main reasons given for implementing such measures continue to be perceived  vulnerabilities/ limited country capacity and the nature of the virus epidemiology (figure 2).    WHO also monitors other sources of information: IATA1, SOS international2 and countries\u2019 official websites.  Measures such as flight suspensions are often implemented by industries, which are not bound by the IHR (2005;  and such measures are often driven by economic considerations, such as reduced demand, or concerns for crew  staff3. Preliminary analysis shows that in some countries such travel measures may have delayed the importation of  new cases, while in other countries the \u201crestrictions\u201d did not stop the importation of new case.    WHO reiterates that measures that restrict the movement of people during this outbreak should be proportionate to  the public health risk, short in duration and reviewed regularly as more information about the virus, the disease  epidemiology and clinical characteristics becomes available.

Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China (n=32 778), by date of report and  WHO region through 10 March 2020         STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                             \f  PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian);  Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory  diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel  Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian);  and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and  COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response.   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.                        \fRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the  Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   OR  B.

WHO continues to highlight the need for prioritization of personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies for frontline  healthcare workers.  To help make supplies available, OSL and partners in the Pandemic Supply Chain Network  (PSCN) have agreed on mechanisms to secure global warehousing for donated COVID-19 emergency supplies.     OSL are also working with ventilator and respirator equipment manufacturers to develop technical guidance for  oxygen therapy and related equipment in the context of COVID-19.    Together with WFP, UNICEF and the World Bank, OSL continues to work on a proposal for a Supply Chain  Coordination Cell to support the UN Crisis Management Team with improved information and coordination to  support strategic guidance, operational decision-making, and overall monitoring.      Since the beginning of the outbreak, OSL have shipped more than 584,000 surgical masks, 47,000 N95 masks,  620,000 gloves, 72,000 gowns and 11,000 goggles to 57 countries.    OSL have also shipped laboratory tests to more than 120 countries to facilitate COVID-19 testing,    In cooperation with the International Humanitarian City (IHC) in Dubai and with aircraft provided by the government  of the UAE, OSL organized a flight from Dubai to Iran on March 2, to support the first delivery of emergency PPE and  lab tests.    In collaboration with WHO Health Operations, an Intensive Care Unit-assessment form is being finalized in order to  facilitate independent assessment of ICUs and identify existing supplies to support COVID-19 response activities.                                                       \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China (n=28 674), by date of report and  WHO region through 09 March 2020         STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                             \f  PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian);  Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory  diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel  Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian);  and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and  COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response.   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.                        \fRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the  Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   OR  B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-  19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;   OR  C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease   (e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains  the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.    \u2022   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory     Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.    \u2022   Information regarding laboratory guidance can be found here.                   \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                                                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 48   Data as reported by national authorities by 10AM CET 08 March 2020                  HIGHLIGHTS   \u2022  8 new countries/territories/areas (Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Faroe Islands, French  Guiana, Maldives, Malta, Martinique, and Republic of Moldova) have reported  cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.    \u2022  Over 100 countries have now reported laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-  \u2022  WHO  has  issued  a  consolidated  package  of  existing  preparedness  and  response guidance for countries to enable them to slow and stop COVID-19  transmission  and  save  lives.

legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its  frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   ** \u201cTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  \u2020\u2020Egypt is classified as \u201cImported cases only\u201d with the exception of a Nile Cruise ship currently in Egyptian international waters that is  experiencing local transmission.                   \fFigure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China (n=24,727), by date of report and  WHO region through 08 March 2020       STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                              \f      PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian);  Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory  diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel  Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian);  and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and  COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response.   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your   \fhealthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the  Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   OR  B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-  19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;   OR  C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease   (e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains  the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.    \u2022   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory     Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.    \u2022   Information regarding laboratory guidance can be found here.                   \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                                                       Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 47   Data as reported by national authorities by 10AM CET 07 March 2020                  HIGHLIGHTS   \u2022  5 new countries/territories/areas (Colombia, Holy See, Peru, Serbia, and Togo)   have reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.    \u2022  The global number of reported cases of COVID-19 has surpassed 100,000.    \u2022  OpenWHO  has  reached  161,  000   in  COVID-19  courses.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China (n=21,110), by date of report and  WHO region through 07 March 2020       STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                               \f      PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the   response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online  courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel  coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian);  Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory  diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel  Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian);  and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and  COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response.   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your   \fhealthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the  Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   OR  B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-  19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;   OR  C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease   (e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains  the clinical presentation.

Both cause respiratory  disease, yet there are important differences between the two viruses and how they spread. This has important  implications for the public health measures that can be implemented to respond to each virus.     Q. How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?   Firstly, COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory  disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death.     Secondly, both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. As a result, the same public health  measures, such as hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and  immediately disposing of the tissue), are important actions all can take to prevent infection.     Q. How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?    The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter  median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the  time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6  days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID- 19.      Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission \u2013transmission of the  virus before the appearance of symptoms \u2013 is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are  learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this  does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.      The reproductive number \u2013 the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual \u2013 is  understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both  COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.      Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data  indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low.  Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from  adults, rather than vice versa.     While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different.  For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection,  requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection  would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection.    Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying  chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that  older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.     Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of  COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the  number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number  of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually  well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care.     Q. What medical interventions are available for COVID-19 and influenza viruses?  While there are a number of therapeutics currently in clinical trials in China and more than 20 vaccines in  development for COVID-19, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19.

While the influenza vaccine is not effective against COVID-19 virus, it is  highly recommended to get vaccinated each year to prevent influenza infection.    \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

employed and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on  the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its  frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  \u2021Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.   \u00a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO  region through 06 March 2020       STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                              \f      To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and  Russian);  Critical Care of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory  diseases - ePROTECT (available in English and French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus  (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian);  Critical Care Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (available in  English and French); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support  country preparedness and response.  \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One  such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19   \fand whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the  Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   OR  B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-  19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;   OR  C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease   (e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains  the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.    \u2022   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory     Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.    \u2022   Information regarding laboratory guidance can be found here.                   \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                                                                                   Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 45   Data as reported by national authorities by 10AM CET 05 March 2020                  HIGHLIGHTS      \u2022   \u2022  Five  new  countries/territories/areas  (Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,  Gibraltar,  Hungary, Slovenia, and occupied Palestinian territory) have reported cases of  COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.      In anticipation for an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, the South- East Asia Region is preparing to roll out rapid response activities by engaging  with  communities,  procuring  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE),  and  ensuring laboratories have the capacity to test for COVID-19 or ship samples  to global referral laboratories. More information can be found here.      \u2022  The  WHO  Director-General  emphasized  the  importance  of  implementing  a  comprehensive approach to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Educating the  population,  expanding  surveillance,  caring  for  patients,  and  strengthening  preparedness  systems  are  key  to  interrupting  transmission.  The  WHO  Director-General\u2019s remarks can be found here.    \u2022  WHO\u2019s initiative called the WHO Network for Information in Epidemics (EPI- WIN)  leverages  all  communications  platforms  to  amplify  evidence-based  information.

Infodemics can spread misinformation, disinformation and rumors during a health emergency. Infodemics can  hamper an effective public health response and create confusion and distrust among people. To manage infodemics,  WHO has developed an innovative communication initiative called the WHO Network for Information in Epidemics  (EPI-WIN).      During emergencies demand for information is high, there are often many unknowns and people will seek  information from sources and individuals and entities they trust. WHO, through EPI-WIN, has identified such trusted  sources and engaged them not only as amplifiers of accurate, timely information, but also as advisers on the kind of  information that their constituents need and urgently want to see.      Information exchange takes place through regular engagement calls with these \u201ctrust chains\u201d.  EPI-WIN leverages all  communications platforms available to it and partners with these trusted channels to amplify evidence-based  information tailored to different audiences, answering pertinent questions as the event unfolds and linking them to  additional response assets.            A \u201ctrust chain\u201d with employers and employees \u2013 the world of work  Such a \u201ctrust chain\u201d has been established around the world of work. Workers spend approximately one-third of their  adult lives at work. Because of this, employers and businesses can serve as amplifiers of trusted information about  COVID-19 for employees. Employers in both private and public sector are asking how to protect their staff,  contractors and customers from COVID-19.  Employees associations and trade unions are also seeking information  on how WHO policies, guidance and recommendations can be implemented in their workplace settings.    Working with the World Economic Forum, EPI-WIN has established networks with the key business sectors and  public enterprises likely to be impacted by COVID-19 and future epidemics. These have been grouped into networks  of Healthcare & Health Workers, Travel & Tourism, Food & Agriculture and International Mass Gatherings. Within  each network, there are multi-national enterprises, professional associations and UN specialized bodies representing  sectors that employ tens of millions of people and account for many billions of dollars in economic activity.    EPI-WIN is also working with WHO\u2019s Department of Occupational Safety and Health and their counterpart; global  trade unions through the International Labor Organization (ILO)\u2019s Bureau of Workers Activities (ACTRAV) and the  International Trade Union Council (ITUC) which brings together affiliated trade union bodies that represent 210  million workers in 163 countries.     \f  The engagement with trade unions has allowed many concerns to be raised around issues that could impact upon  the effectiveness of public health policies and interventions aimed at containing the COVID-19 epidemic.   These  include issues such as infection prevention and rights of public-facing workers in health, social care and retail  sectors; safe staffing levels when sickness absences may lead to fewer workers facing potentially unsafe increases in  workload; income protection for those isolated, self-isolating or requiring time off work because of school/transport  closures; and discussions with employers on remote working and flexible working patterns. EPI-WIN also works  closely with the WHO Health Workforce Department that collaborates with approximately 80 global healthworker  associations.

reclassification as additional data become  available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.  Terms:    266   53         -   -  -  -  -   Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by  increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories).  Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   **\u201dTerritories\u201d include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  ^^Reduced from prior situation reports due to separation of territories, and Liechtenstein from Switzerland  Erratum: Total cases, new cases, and total deaths for Australia have been corrected.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO  region through 04 March 2020                          \fSTRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.       PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and  Russian);  Critical Care of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory  diseases - ePROTECT (available in English and French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus  (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian);  Critical Care Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (available in         \f   OR   OR      English and French); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support  country preparedness and response.   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the  Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-  19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;   C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease   \f(e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains  the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.    \u2022   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory     Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.

Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.   \f-   Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   \u00b6 Includes cases from Gibraltar  \u2021Cases identified on a cruise ship currently in Japanese territorial waters.  ** Days since last report have been adjusted to reflect 10AM-10AM epidemiologic days rather than calendar days  \u00a7343 female/469 male/11 856 unknown. 38 healthcare workers (10 female/13 male/ 15 unknown).

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and  Russian);  Critical Care of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory  diseases - ePROTECT (available in English and French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus  (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian);  Critical Care Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (available in         \f   OR   OR      English and French); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support  country preparedness and response.   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the  Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-  19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;   C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease   \f(e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains  the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.    \u2022   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory     Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.

The  WHO  Regional  Director  of  the  Eastern  Mediterranean  region  reiterated the need to enhance surveillance and response activities, and share  critical  information,  as  being  essential  to  containing  the  outbreak  and  strengthening health systems. More information can be found here.    \u2022  The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is implementing a comprehensive  plan  to  support  country  preparedness  and  containment  efforts  for  COVID-19.   Barbados  was  one  of  the  first  Caribbean  countries  to  acquire  test  kits  and  reagents for COVID-19 detection, and receive training on how to use them. More  information can be found here.    \u2022  Real-time training is critical for effective preparedness and response.

Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   \u2021Cases identified on a cruise ship currently in Japanese territorial waters.  \u00a7310 female/416 male/9840 unknown. 34 healthcare workers (9 female/13 male/ 12 unknown).

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO  region with complete days of reporting through 02 March 2020           STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.                            \f   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, Spanish, and Portuguese);  Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT  (available in French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19); Critical Care Severe  Acute Respiratory Infection   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).     \f  If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       CASE DEFINITIONS    WHO periodically updates the  Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  document which includes case definitions.      For easy reference, case definitions are included below.     Suspect case   A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,   cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a  history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation  report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.   B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-  19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;   C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease   (e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains  the clinical presentation.     Probable case   A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.    \u2022   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory     Confirmed case   A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.

Recent OSL activities are as follows:      \u2022  Together with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF)   and the World Bank, WHO is working on a proposal to establish a Supply Chain Coordination Cell. This  interagency team will help improve information management and coordination to support strategic  guidance, operational decision-making, and overall monitoring.     \u2022  WHO has contacted the Global Health Security Initiative to address access to strategic national stockpiles.   WHO is also engaging with the Gates Foundation, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the World Bank  and UNICEF, both as part of the Supply Chain Coordination Cell and to establish bridge financing  mechanisms, data access and analysis to support planning, forecasting and market access.   \u2022  Weekly meetings of the Pandemic Supply Chain Partnership Network (PSCN) continue, along with bilateral   discussions with manufacturers and distributors to advocate for the release and prioritization of supplies for  the health care response. A technical briefing on the personal protective equipment (PPE) market situation is  planned for G20 members next week, and PSCN members will engage with WFP to develop infection  prevention and control (IPC) technical guidance on cargo handling.   \u2022   In cooperation with the International Humanitarian City in Dubai and with aircraft provided by the  government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), WHO has organized a flight from Dubai to Iran to support  the first delivery of emergency PPE and laboratory tests.   \u2022  Since February 14, WHO has shipped PPE to more than 47 countries, and there are currently 22 additional   countries to which PPE shipments are ready to be made. WHO has also shipped laboratory testing  equipment to 93 countries.                                      \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is  evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within  categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and  other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   \u2021Cases identified on a cruise ship currently in Japanese territorial waters.  \u00a7302 female/411 male/8061 unknown. 32 healthcare workers (8 female/12 male/ 12 unknown).   **Corrected from prior days due to correction of date of report  \u00a7\u00a7Corrected from prior days due to verification of data  Erratum: Transmission classification for the Dominican Republic, Israel and Sweden have been corrected.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO  region with complete days of reporting through 01 March 2020         STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.       PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.         \f   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, Spanish, and Portuguese);  Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT  (available in French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19); Critical Care Severe  Acute Respiratory Infection   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data  collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to  characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,  spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your  risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your  healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19  and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take  appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).       \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 41   Data as reported by 10AM CET 01 March 2020                    HIGHLIGHTS     \u2022  Five new Member States (Azerbaijan, Ecuador, Ireland, Monaco and Qatar)   reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.      \u2022  Working  with  clinicians  is  crucial  to  understanding  the  clinical  presentation,  natural history and treatment interventions for COVID-19. WHO has published  interim clinical guidance, clinical training materials and has launched a global  clinical data platform to gather data and improve care for COVID-19 patients.

A majority of patients with COVID-19 are adults.  Among 44 672 patients in China with confirmed infection, 2.1%  were below the age of 201.  The most commonly reported symptoms included fever, dry cough, and shortness of  breath, and most patients (80%) experienced mild illness. Approximately 14% experienced severe disease and 5%  were critically ill.  Early reports suggest that illness severity is associated with age (>60 years old) and co-morbid  disease.     Clinical care of patients with COVID-19 focuses on early recognition, immediate isolation and implementation of  appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures; provision of symptomatic care for those with mild  illness; and optimized supportive care for those with severe disease. WHO has published patient management  guidance, including interim clinical care guidance for hospitalized patients and home care guidance for those with  mild disease that may be treated at home in isolation when the health system is strained.     Oxygen therapy is the major treatment intervention for patients with severe COVID-19. All countries should work to  optimize the availability of pulse oximeters and medical oxygen systems. Mortality in those with critical illness has  been reported as over 50%, thus implementation of proven critical care interventions such as lung protective  ventilation should be optimized. COVID-19 critical care clinical training materials are available on  https://openwho.org/courses/severe-acute-respiratory-infection. The first regional COVID-19 Clinical Case  Management training was conducted in Brazzaville from 25-28 February 2020 with representatives from 18  countries of the WHO African region. WHO will continue to conduct such trainings to increase global knowledge on  the management and care of patients with COVID-19.    WHO launched the Global COVID-19 Clinical Data Platform to aggregate and report on clinical severity to inform the  public health response. Member States are encouraged to contribute by contacting  EDCARN@who.int for log-in  information.     As there is currently no known effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19, the WHO R&D Blueprint has prioritized  investigational therapeutics and developed a master randomized clinical trial protocol that can be used and adapted  at the national level. There are many ongoing ethics-approved clinical trials evaluating a number of different  therapeutic interventions globally including priority agents such as ritonavir/lopinavir and remdesivir.     1.

Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.  Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.    Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.  Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)   \u2021Cases identified on a cruise ship currently in Japanese territorial waters.  \u00a7278 female/393 male/6498 unknown. 31 healthcare workers (7 female/12 male/ 12 unknown).

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases (n=6567) reported outside of China, by date of report and  WHO region with complete days of reporting through 29 February 2020         \fSTRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts  and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further  international spread*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.       PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection  prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are  updated regularly.   \u2022  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, Spanish, and Portuguese);  Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT  (available in French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19); Critical Care Severe  Acute Respiratory Infection         \f\u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and  contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to  gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of  COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. It\u2019s a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you  accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). Seek  guidance from WHO, your healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate  information on COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the  situation and take appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).             \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 40   Data as reported by 10AM CET 29 February 2020                  HIGHLIGHTS     19 in the past 24 hours.      \u2022  Two new Member States (Mexico and San Marino) reported cases of COVID-  \u2022  WHO  has  published  the  Rational  use  of  personal  protective  equipment  for  COVID-19.

To ensure  evidence-based quality guidance and prompt response to global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE),  WHO has convened the IPC expert global network of specialists from around the world since the beginning of the  outbreak.  Experts  are  members  of  the  Global  Infection  Prevention  and  Control  Network  (GIPCN)  or  members  of  relevant  institutions  caring  for  COVID-19  patients.  This  network  discusses  technical  aspects  of  IPC  measures,  and  shares epidemiological updates and experiences across affected countries. In consultation with this global IPC expert  network, WHO has released three key IPC interim guidance materials.    Updates on IPC activities include the following:    \u2022  Publishing  the  guidance  document:  Rational  use  of  personal  protective  equipment  for  COVID-19.  This  document summarizes WHO recommendations for the appropriate use of PPE in health care and community  settings, including the handling of cargo.    \u2022  Deployment of IPC specialists to Italy to support the COVID-19 response and to facilitate IPC training in the   European region.    \u2022  Development of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) in response to queries from the public and communities   on blood safety, PPE for specimen collection, cleaning & disinfection, self-isolation and self-monitoring.    \u2022   Launching the OpenWHO online course \u201cInfection Prevention and Control (IPC) for COVID-19\u201d on 25 February.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is  spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that  you may feel anxious about the outbreak. It\u2019s a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you  accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). Seek  guidance from WHO, your healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate  information on COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the  situation and take appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).    If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the  advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection  will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and in some people,  it can be fatal. Older people,  and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or  diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).             \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "               Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 39   Data as reported by 10AM CET 28 February 2020                  HIGHLIGHTS    \u2022  Five  new  Member  States  (Belarus,  Lithuania,  Netherlands,  New  Zealand,  and   Nigeria) reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.    \u2022  WHO  has  increased the  assessment  of the  risk  of  spread  and  risk of  impact  of  COVID-19 to very high at the global level.

Seven States Parties provided updates on the measures they have  previously reported on. Eleven of the 41 States Parties are now reporting such measures against countries other  than China. No trade restrictions have been reported to date. Table 1 presents a summary of additional health  measures officially reported to WHO under Article 43 from 6 \u2013 28 February, by WHO region.

The public health rationale for these additional health measures is mainly linked to  vulnerabilities (e.g. lack of capacity for diagnostic and response, small island states context) in receiving countries,  and the uncertainties about the virus transmission and disease severity.     Preliminary analysis of countries reporting cases that have imposed restrictive measures suggest that such measures  may have delayed the importation of new cases, but did not prevent the importation of the disease. WHO has  emphasized to Member States that additional measures should be proportionate to the public health risk, short in  duration, and reconsidered in light of the evolution of the outbreak and the constant advancements of knowledge  about the virus and the disease.    WHO has published updated advice for international traffic, and continues to recommend against the application of  any travel or trade restrictions in relation to the current COVID-19 outbreak.    WHO continues to engage with travel and tourism international organizations and industry associations to enable  compliance with the IHR on avoidance of unnecessary interference with international traffic. Joint statements have  been issued by WHO in collaboration with the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and UN World Tourism  Organization (UNWTO), and will shortly be issues in collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO).            \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

This  guidance is continually updated as more data becomes available and includes advice on sample collection, diagnostic  testing, and pathogen characterization. Specific interim guidance on biosafety in the laboratory has also been  published. An update to the guidance for the international shipment of specimens will follow soon. WHO is utilizing  an international network of expert laboratories to provide support in the detection of the COVID-19 virus globally.    Figure 2. WHO international reference laboratories for the COVID-19 virus.      The diagnostic landscape of this outbreak is changing quickly. The first COVID-19 cases were detected using genomic  sequencing, but multiple RT-PCR commercial and non-commercial assays have since been developed. As the  international case load increases, there is an urgent need to rapidly scale up diagnostic capacity to detect and  confirm cases of COVID-19. WHO has taken a three-pronged approach to enhance global diagnostic capacity for the  COVID-19 virus:    1)  Developing a WHO network of 15 COVID-19 reference laboratories with demonstrated expertise in the   molecular detection of coronaviruses. These international laboratories can support national labs to confirm  the COVID-19 virus and troubleshoot their molecular assays.     2)  Strengthening national capacity for detection of the COVID-19 virus so that diagnostic testing can be  performed rapidly without the need for overseas shipping. Existing global networks for detection of  respiratory pathogens are being utilized including, notably, the National Influenza Centers that support the  Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System.     3)  Ensuring ongoing test availability. WHO has procured a commercial assay (manufactured under ISO:13485)   with strong performance data and shipped to over 150 laboratories globally as an interim measure for  Member States requesting support. The main goal is to strengthen global diagnostic capacity for detection of  the COVID-19 virus. Support is now also provided to ensure the quality of testing through the  implementation of an External Quality Assurance mechanism.     Public health efforts are targeted at both interrupting further transmission and monitoring the spread of COVID-19.  As reports of asymptomatic cases increase, the need for reliable serology testing is becoming more urgent. There are  a number of groups working on this and developments are being monitored.     \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID- 19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, Spanish, and Portuguese);  Critical Care of  Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT  (available in French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19); Critical Care Severe  Acute Respiratory Infection   \f\u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and interrupt onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have  not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low.  However, it\u2019s understandable that you may feel stressed and anxious about the situation. It\u2019s a good idea to get the  facts to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. (See Frequently Asked  Questions) Your healthcare provider, your national public health authority and your employer are all potential  sources of accurate information on COVID-19 and whether it is in your area. It is important to be informed of the  situation where you live and take appropriate measures to protect yourself. (See  Protection measures for  everyone).  If you are in an area where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow  the advice issued by national and local health authorities. Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild  illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre- existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID- 19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish);  Critical Care of Severe Acute  Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case   \fdefinitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have  not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low.  However, it\u2019s understandable that you may feel stressed and anxious about the situation. It\u2019s a good idea to get the  facts to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. (See Frequently Asked  Questions) Your healthcare provider, your national public health authority and your employer are all potential  sources of accurate information on COVID-19 and whether it is in your area. It is important to be informed of the  situation where you live and take appropriate measures to protect yourself. (See  Protection measures for  everyone).  If you are in an area where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow  the advice issued by national and local health authorities. Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild  illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre- existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable.  (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is  spreading).             \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                       HIGHLIGHTS     Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 36   Data as reported by 10AM CET 25 February 2020*                  \u2022  Four  new  Member  States  (Afghanistan,  Bahrain,  Iraq,  and  Oman)  reported   cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.      \u2022  For healthcare workers and public health professionals, WHO has an online  course  titled  Infection  Prevention  and  Control  (IPC)  for  Novel  Coronavirus  (COVID-19).

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID- 19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish);  Critical Care of Severe Acute  Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case   \fdefinitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have  not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low.  However, it\u2019s understandable that you may feel stressed and anxious about the situation. It\u2019s a good idea to get the  facts to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. (See Frequently Asked  Questions) Your healthcare provider, your national public health authority and your employer are all potential  sources of accurate information on COVID-19 and whether it is in your area. It is important to be informed of the  situation where you live and take appropriate measures to protect yourself. (See  Protection measures for  everyone).  If you are in an area where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow  the advice issued by national and local health authorities. Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild  illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre- existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable.  (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is  spreading).             \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                          Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 35   Data as reported by 10AM CET 24 February 2020*                  HIGHLIGHTS     hours.      \u2022  One new Member State (Kuwait) reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24   \u2022  Since  the  emergence  of  COVID-19  we  have  seen  instances  of  public  stigmatization  among  specific  populations,  and  the  rise  of  harmful  stereotypes.

In the case of COVID-19, there are an increasing number of reports of public stigmatization against people from  areas affected by the epidemic. Unfortunately, this means that people are being labelled, stereotyped, separated,  and/or experience loss of status and discrimination because of a potential negative affiliation with the disease.    Given that COVID-19 is a new disease, it is understandable that its emergence and spread cause confusion, anxiety  and fear among the general public. These factors can give rise to harmful stereotypes.    Stigma can:   \u2022  Drive people to hide the illness to avoid discrimination    \u2022  Prevent people from seeking health care immediately    \u2022  Discourage them from adopting healthy behaviours      Such barriers could potentially contribute to more severe health problems, ongoing transmission, and difficulties  controlling infectious diseases during an infectious disease outbreak. The International Federation of Red Cross and  Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), UNICEF and the WHO are developing community-based guides and global campaigns  to thwart the effects of stigma on people and the COVID-19 response.     Do your part. Governments, citizens, media, key influencers and communities have an important role to play in  preventing and stopping stigma. We all need to be intentional and thoughtful when communicating on social media  and other communication platforms, showing supportive behaviors around COVID-19.    Here are some examples and tips on possible actions to counter stigmatizing attitudes:     \u2022  Spreading the facts: Stigma can be heightened by insufficient knowledge about how the new coronavirus disease   (COVID-19) is transmitted and treated, and how to prevent infection.    \u2022  Engaging social influencers such as religious leaders on prompting reflection about people who are stigmatized   and how to support them, or respected celebrities to amplify messages that reduce stigma.    \u2022  Amplify the voices, stories and images of local people who have experienced COVID-19 and have recovered or  who have supported a loved one through recovery to emphasise that most people do recover from COVID-19.   \u2022  Make sure you portray different ethnic groups. Materials should show diverse communities that are being   affected, and show communities working together to prevent the spread of COVID-19.    \u2022  Balanced reporting. Media reporting should be balanced and contextualised, disseminating evidence-based   information and helping combat rumour and misinformation that could lead to stigmatisation.   \u2022  Link up. There are a number of initiatives to address stigma and stereotyping. It is key to link up to these   activities to create a movement and a positive environment that shows care and empathy for all.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID- 19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish);  Critical Care of Severe Acute  Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,   \fseverity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the  general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.      \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                       HIGHLIGHTS          Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 34   Data as reported by 10AM CET 23 February 2020*                  \u2022  No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish);  Critical Care of Severe Acute  Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,   \fseverity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the  general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.      \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                       Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation  Report \u2013 33   Data as reported by 10AM CET 22 February 2020*                  HIGHLIGHTS     past 24 hours.       \u2022  Two new countries (Lebanon and Israel) reported cases of COVID-19 in the   \u2022  The role of environmental contamination in the transmission of COVID-19 is  not yet clear.

The most likely ecological reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 are bats,  but it is believed that the virus jumped the species barrier to humans from another intermediate animal host. This  intermediate animal host could be a domestic food animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal which has  not yet been identified.    WHO continues to collaborate with experts, Member States and other partners to identify gaps and research priorities  for the control of COVID-19, and provide advice to countries and individuals on prevention measures. National food  safety authorities have been following this event with the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN)  Secretariat to seek more information on the potential for persistence of the virus on foods traded internationally and  the  potential  role  of  food  in  the  transmission  of  the  virus.  Experiences  from  previous  outbreaks  of  related  coronaviruses, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory  syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) show that transmission through food consumption did not occur. To date, there  have  not  been  any  reports  of  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  virus  through  food.  However,  concerns  were  expressed  about the potential for these viruses to persist on raw foods of animal origin.    Currently, there are investigations conducted to evaluate the viability and survival time of SARS-CoV-2. In general,  coronaviruses are very stable in a frozen state according to studies of other coronaviruses, which have shown survival  for up to two years at -20\u00b0C. Studies conducted on SARS-CoV ad MERS-CoV indicate that these viruses can persist on  different surfaces for up to a few days depending on a combination of parameters such as temperature, humidity and  light.  For  example,  at  refrigeration  temperature  (4\u00b0C),  MERS-CoV  can  remain  viable  for  up  to  72  hours.  Current  evidence  on  other  coronavirus  strains  shows  that  while  coronaviruses  appear  to  be  stable  at  low  and  freezing  temperatures for a certain period, food hygiene and good food safety practices can prevent their transmission through  food.  Specifically,  coronaviruses  are  thermolabile,  which  means  that  they  are  susceptible  to  normal  cooking  temperatures (70\u00b0C). Therefore, as a general rule, the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be  avoided. Raw meat, raw milk or raw animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with  uncooked foods.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID- 19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish);  Critical Care of Severe Acute  Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,   \fseverity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the  general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.      \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                       Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 31   Data as reported by 20 February 2020*                     HIGHLIGHTS     past 24 hours.      \u2022  One new country (Islamic Republic of Iran) reported cases of COVID-19 in the   \u2022  China has revised their guidance on case classification for COVID-19, removing  the classification of \u201cclinically diagnosed\u201d previously used for Hubei province,   and  retaining  only  \u201csuspected\u201d  and  \u201cconfirmed\u201d  for  all  areas,  the  latter  requiring  laboratory  confirmation.

The goals of global surveillance are to: 1) Monitor the global extent of the epidemic; 2)  Provide early epidemiological information to support risk assessment at the national, regional and global levels; 3)  Rapidly detect new cases in countries where the virus was not previously circulating; 4) Monitor trends of the disease  after a first case is imported and; 5) Provide epidemiological information to guide response measures. In line with the  International Health Regulations (2005), all Member States\u2019 IHR National Focal Points were requested to immediately  report  any  new  confirmed  case  of  COVID-19  and,  within  48  hours,  provide  information  related  to  clinical,  epidemiological, and travel history using the WHO standardized case reporting form. The current version of the case  reporting form can be found here in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese.    WHO regions implemented immediate reporting of COVID-19 cases through systems already in place \u2013 such as The  European Surveillance Systemin the European Region, EMFLU in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and FluNet in the  Americas Region; or by setting up a new electronic data collection system (South-East Asia region).The flow of data  from WHO Regional Offices to WHO HQ was organized using the existing Global Influenza Surveillance system, allowing  regions  to  rapidly  transfer  information.  A  Global  Surveillance  COVID-19  database  centralizing  all  COVID-19  cases  reported from outside China is maintained at WHO HQ, and data analysis is conducted daily to: follow the transmission  of the disease between countries; describe the characteristics of human- to- human transmission within clusters of  cases; describe the characteristics of affected persons and their exposure history; and support the evaluation of public  health measures implemented in response to the epidemic .        SUBJECT IN FOCUS (UPDATE): Advanced Analytics and Mathematical Modelling    Since the publication of modeling estimates in yesterday\u2019s \u2018Subject in Focus\u2019, one research group (Ref. 12) has  provided a correction of their estimate of the Infection-Fatality Ratio (IFR), with the new estimate being 0.94% (95%  confidence interval 0.37-2.9). This replaces the lowest estimate of IFR of 0.33%, but remains below the highest  estimate of 1.0% (Ref. 11).                                  \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID- 19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish as well);  Critical Care of Severe  Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,   \fseverity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the  general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.      \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                                                     Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 30   Data as reported by 19 February 2020*                     HIGHLIGHTS        \u2022  WHO   \u2022  No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.    is  working  with  an   international  network  of  statisticians  and  mathematical modelers to estimate key epidemiologic parameters of COVID- 19, such as the incubation period (the time between infection and symptom  onset), case fatality ratio (CFR, the proportion of cases that die), and the serial  interval (the time between symptom onset of a primary and secondary case).

In  addition to descriptive analyses of available epidemiologic and clinical data, mathematical modelling and advanced  analytics are helpful tools that can be used to estimate key transmission and severity parameters.     WHO has been working with an international network of statisticians and mathematical modelers to estimate key  epidemiologic parameters of COVID-19, such as the incubation period (the time between infection and symptom  onset), case fatality ratio (CFR, the proportion of cases who die), infection fatality ratio (IFR, the portion of all of  those infected who die), and the serial interval (the time between symptom onset of a primary and secondary case).     To calculate these parameters, statisticians and modelers use case-based data from COVID-19 surveillance activities,  and data captured from early investigations, such as those studies which evaluate transmission within clusters of  cases in households or other closed settings. Preliminary estimates1,2,3,4,5,6,7 of median incubation period are 5-6 days  (ranging from 0-14 days) and estimates for the serial interval4,8 range from 4.4 to 7.5 days. Several estimates have  been shared in pre-print and information will be updated as more information becomes available.     The confirmed case fatality ratio, or CFR, is the total number of deaths divided by the total number of confirmed  cases at one point in time.  Within China, the confirmed CFR, as reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control  and Prevention,9 is 2.3%. This is based on 1023 deaths amongst 44 415 laboratory-confirmed cases as of 11 February.  This CFR does not include the number of more mild infections that may be missed from current surveillance, which  has largely focused on patients with pneumonia requiring hospitalization; nor does it account for the fact that  recently confirmed cases may yet develop severe disease, and some may die. As the outbreak continues, the  confirmed CFR may change. Outside of China, CFR estimates among confirmed cases reported is lower than reported  from within China.  However, it is too early to draw conclusions as to whether there are real differences in the CFR  inside and outside of China, as final outcome data (that is, who will recover and who will die) for the majority of  cases reported from outside China are not yet known.     Modeling is a helpful tool to try to account for missed cases, such as those that are mild cases potentially missed in  current surveillance activities, and the time lag between onset and death.  Using an estimated number of total  infections, the Infection Fatality Ratio can be calculated.  This represents the fraction of all infections (both  diagnosed and undiagnosed) that result in death. Based on these available analyses, current IFR estimates10,11,12  range from 0.3% to 1%.  Without population-based serologic studies, it is not yet possible to know what proportion  of the population has been infected with COVID-19.     Modeling has also been used to estimate the impact of the 23 January, 2020 Wuhan travel ban on reducing  transmission both inside and outside of China.13,14 According to these models, travel restrictions alone are projected  to have only a modest effect on the progression of the outbreak; they would need to be combined with other public  health interventions, such as early case isolation, other forms of mobility restrictions, social distancing and  population-level behavioral changes to be effective.  This is in line with several studies on travel restrictions during past influenza pandemics, including H1N1, reported in  the recently published paper on \u201cNonpharmaceutical Measures for Pandemic Influenza in Nonhealthcare Settings\u2014 International Travel-Related Measures\u201d15 .    During the February 2019 COVID-19 WHO Global research and innovation forum, the international gathering of  scientists stressed that additional information is needed to refine the forecasting models, and to inform targeted  guidance and measures for the public health response. This information should come from early investigations, such  as:   \f\u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022   in the community and in households  through health care workers risk factor assessments   through clinical characterization of hospitalized cases   in returning traveller cohort studies      WHO has provided protocols for these investigations, which are available on the WHO website here.  This  information will help to update the estimates of parameters.                                               \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID- 19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory   viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish as well);  Critical Care  of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT   \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,   \fseverity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the  general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.                                                       1 Liu T, Hu J, Kang M, Lin L, Zhong H, Xiao J, et al.

The country- level perspective is aggregated to obtain a global  view  on  the  overall  demand  for  PPE  necessary  for  frontline  healthcare  workers.  Due  to  the  growing  demand  and  consumption of PPE, OSL is collaborating with WHO disease specialists to develop and disseminate a guiding document  on the rational use of PPE.     In the meantime, OSL continues to accelerate the work of the Pandemic Supply Chain Network (PSCN), which includes  manufacturers of medical products and medicines, medical distributors, and logistics providers.      Since the activation of the PSCN, the market for PPE continues to experience unprecedented demand. Government  export restrictions have continued to limit the supply of products across borders. The PSCN is continuously exploring  options  with  its  stakeholders  to  alleviate  the  demand  and  increase  the  supply  to  ensure  access  to  PPE  for  those  countries most vulnerable and most in need.  This includes working with WHO technical specialists to advocate via the  PSCN  on  the  proper  use  of  PPE,  understanding  the  potential  for  manufacturing  expansion  outside  China  (a  major  source  of  crucial  commodities),  and  working  with  stakeholders  to  support  the  prioritization  of  PPE  for  frontline  healthcare workers. The PSCN will also prepare for any bottlenecks in the market for other supplies as listed in the  Disease Commodity Package.       On 14 February, OSL started the dispatch of COVID-19 laboratory testing kits for 56 countries. As of 17 February, 37  shipments have been dispatched to 34 countries and three regional offices.     The  WHO  global  supply  team  had  already  dispatched  28  PPE  shipments  totalling  more  than  12  000  kg  to  priority  countries in the Western Pacific, South-East Asia and African regions. Another 24 shipments are being processed this  week to cover other priority countries.    With the technical support of the WHO Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) team, OSL continues to update the Disease  Commodity Package (DCP) for COVID-19. This document provides the technical guidance and specifications on the  critical supplies necessary to fight COVID-19.  Responding organizations and countries preparing and responding to  COVID-19 are able to use the DCP to secure the correct supplies in the areas of surveillance, prevention and control,  and case management.                                         \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID- 19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   novel coronaviruses.    \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of   \fcountermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the  general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.    \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 28   Data as reported by 17 February 2020*                     HIGHLIGHTS     \u2022  No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.    \u2022  From today, WHO will be reporting all confirmed cases, including both   laboratory-confirmed as previously reported, and those reported as clinically  diagnosed (currently only applicable to Hubei province, China). From 13  February through 16 February, we reported only laboratory confirmed cases  for Hubei province as mentioned in the situation report published on 13  February.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the  general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.    \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation  Report \u2013 27   Data as reported by 16 February 2020*                     \u2022  No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.    \u2022  A third death of a COVID-19 patient has been reported outside of China.

Studies to assess the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of cases in different settings are  therefore critical to furthering our understanding of this virus and associated disease. They will also provide the robust  information needed to feed forecasting models.    Several early investigation master protocols or master forms are available for countries:   1.  FFX (First Few X number of cases and their close contacts) transmission protocol: case and close contact   tracing in the general population. Contact: earlyinvestigations-2019-nCoV@who.int     FFX is the primary investigation protocol to be initiated upon identification of the initial laboratory-confirmed   cases of COVID-19 in a country.     For a more targeted approach on specific groups and more precise estimation of epidemiological parameters,   three other investigation protocols are available:   2.  Household (HH) transmission study protocol. Contact: earlyinvestigations-2019-nCoV@who.int   3.  Risk factors assessment for Health Workers (HCW) protocol. Contact: earlyinvestigations-2019-  nCoV@who.int   4.  Environmental sampling protocol (in development)               5.  Global COVID-19 Clinical Characterization Case Record Form : a standard approach to collect clinical data of  hospitalized patients is necessary to better understand clinical characteristics of the disease and treatment  interventions. Anonymized clinical data and information related to patients with suspected or confirmed  infections can be shared. Contact: EDCARN@who.int for log-in details.     To support country implementation of the first two protocols (FFX, HH), it is recommended  to  use  the  Go.Data  field  electronic  tool  for  case  and  contacts  data  collection  and  management. The FFX and HH protocol questionnaire templates are available  in Go.Data.  Visit www.who.int/godata or contact godata@who.int for more information.    These protocols and forms have been designed so that data can be rapidly and systematically collected and shared in  a format that facilitates aggregation, tabulation and analysis across different settings globally. We encourage any and  all countries and study centres to contribute to this effort regardless of resource  availability or patient volume. The  ownership of the primary data remains firmly with the individual countries/sites.     Data collected using these investigation protocols will be critical to refine recommendations for case definitions  and  surveillance, characterize key epidemiological features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of  disease,  and  impact  on  the  community  and  to  inform  guidance  for  application  of  countermeasures  such  as  case  isolation and contact tracing.

Epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases (n=526) identified outside of China, by date of reporting and travel  history, 15 February 2020          \f   STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and  health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international  spread from China*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.     PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID- 19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   novel coronaviruses.    \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of   \fcountermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the  general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.    \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                       Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 25   Data as reported by 14 February 2020*                     HIGHLIGHTS        \u2022         \u2022  No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.    \u2022  The second death has been reported outside of China, in Japan.

Its aim is to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and  medicines that can be used to save lives and avert further crisis.     In view of the urgency of the COVID-19 outbreak, the international community is mobilizing to find ways to  significantly accelerate the development of interventions including vaccines and therapeutics. Nearly 400 world  scientists met at WHO\u2019s Geneva Headquarters from 11 to 12 February 2020 to assess the current level of knowledge  about the new COVID-19 virus, agree on critical research questions that need to be answered urgently, and identify  ways to work together to accelerate and fund priority research that can contribute to curtail this outbreak and  prepare for future outbreaks. The meeting was organized by WHO, in collaboration with the Global Research  Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness.     Research topics discussed included:  COVID-19 virus natural history, transmission and diagnostics; animal and  environmental research on the virus origin; management measures at the human-animal interface; epidemiological  studies; clinical characterization and management; infection prevention and control, including healthcare workers\u2019  protection; candidate therapeutics R&D; candidate vaccines R&D; ethical considerations for research; and  integrating social sciences in the outbreak response.     Experts identified key knowledge gaps and research priorities, and shared scientific data on ongoing research,  thereby accelerating the generation of critical scientific information to contribute to the control the COVID-19  outbreak. There was broad consensus on the need for research to focus on actions that can save lives now to ensure  that those affected are promptly diagnosed and receive optimal care. Eight immediate research priorities were  agreed as part of this Forum:   1.  Mobilize research on rapid point of care diagnostics for use at the community level  2.  Assess available data to learn what standard of care approaches from China and elsewhere are the most   3.  Evaluate as fast as possible the effect of adjunctive (given in addition to the main treatment) and supportive   effective   therapies   4.  Optimize the use of protective equipment and other infection prevention and control measures in health   care and community settings   5.  Review all available evidence to identify animal host(s), prevent continued spill-over and better understand  virus transmissibility in different contexts over time, the severity of disease and individuals more susceptible  to infection   6.  Accelerate the evaluation of investigational therapeutics and vaccines by using \u201cMaster Protocols\u201d  7.  Maintain a high degree of communication and interaction among funders so that critical research is   implemented   8.  Broadly and rapidly share virus materials, clinical samples and data for immediate public health purposes     For further information and to view documents related to the Forum, please visit this webpage.        \f  SURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

Epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases (n=505) identified outside of China, by date of reporting and travel  history, 14 February 2020          \f   STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and  health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international  spread from China*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and  risk communication.     PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID- 19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   novel coronaviruses.    \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of   \fcountermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the  general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.    \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                       Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 24   Data as reported by 13 February 2020*                     HIGHLIGHTS              \u2022  No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.    \u2022  WHO  has  developed  a  database  to  collect  the  latest  scientific  findings  and   knowledge on Coronavirus disease.

The vast majority of these (151, 89%) do not appear to lead to further transmission of the virus,   while the remaining 19 have been associated with onward transmission within 12 distinct groups of   epidemiologically linked cases (Fig 2). Among these, four groups have involved at least nine individuals. The largest   involves 20 individuals in six countries thus far - United Kingdom (6), France (5), Malaysia (3), Singapore (3), Republic   of Korea (2), Spain (1) - and has been linked to a conference held in Singapore between 20 and 22 January 2020 and   a subsequent ski trip to the French Alps (Table 1, Figure 2). The next largest involves 15 cases and was linked to a   conference in Bavaria, Germany. Among the attendees was an individual with an epidemiological link to confirmed   cases in Wuhan, China. Additionally, one of the 15 cases was detected in, but did not involve transmission within,   Sixteen cases have been reported in four countries for which there are no clearly established epidemiological links.   For all these individuals, investigations are ongoing to establish the mechanism by which they were infected.         Table 1.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.   \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID- 19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   novel coronaviruses.    \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of   \fcountermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the  general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.    \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                                       Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Situation Report \u2013 23   Data as reported by 12 February 2020*                     HIGHLIGHTS     \u2022  No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.    \u2022  WHO  has  published  key  considerations  for  repatriation  and  quarantine  of   travellers in relation to COVID-19.

A  small  mission was sent to Wuhan mid-January, and the Director-General visited in  January.      \u2022  Following WHO best practices for naming of new human infectious diseases,  which  were  developed  in  consultation  and  collaboration  with  the  World  Organisation  for  Animal  Health  (OIE)  and  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO),  WHO  has  named  the  disease  COVID-19, short for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019.\u201d             SITUATION IN NUMBERS  total and new cases in last 24  hours     Globally   43 103 confirmed (2560 new)     China  42 708 confirmed (2484 new)     7333 severe (849 new)       1017 deaths (108 new)     Outside of China        395 confirmed (76 new)          24 countries             1 death     WHO RISK ASSESSMENT    China  Regional Level  High  Global Level  High   Very High        Figure 1.

These sub-species are abundant  and widely present in Southern China, and across Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Recent studies indicate  that more than 500 CoVs have been identified in bats in China. To be noted that serological studies conducted in  rural population living close to bats natural habitat in caves revealed a 2.9% bat-CoV seroprevalence, demonstrating  that humans exposure to bat-CoVs might be common.1    However, the route of transmission to humans at the start of this event remains unclear. Bats are rare in markets in  China but hunted and sold directly to restaurants for food.2 The current most likely hypothesis is that an  intermediary host animal has played a role in the transmission.     Both Chinese and external expert groups are working in trying to identify the animal source of this new virus.  Identifying the animal source of the 2019-nCoV would help to ensure that there will be no further future similar  outbreaks with the same virus and will also help understanding the initial spread of the disease in the Wuhan area. It  would also increase our understanding of the virus and help us understand how these viruses jump from animals to  humans. Thus, providing critical knowledge on how to protect us from future similar events. In this regard,  strengthening food control and market hygiene activities in live food market will be essential to protect people from  similar and other zoonotic diseases.                                                                                                                   1 Wang, N., Li, S.Y., Yang, X.L., Huang, H.M., Zhang, Y.J., Guo, H., Luo, C.M., Miller, M., Zhu, G., Chmura, A.A. and Hagan, E., 2018.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019- nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   novel coronaviruses.    \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of   \fcountermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce  the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.    \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                       Novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV)  Situation Report \u2013 21   Data as reported by 10 February 2020*                     HIGHLIGHTS        \u2022  No new countries reported cases of 2019-nCoV in the past 24 hours.    \u2022  The  WHO  R&D  Blueprint  is  a  global  strategy  and  preparedness  plan  that  allows  the  rapid  activation  of  R&D  activities  during  epidemics.

WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce  the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.    \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                       Novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV)  Situation Report \u2013 20   Data as reported by 9 February 2020*                          HIGHLIGHTS        \u2022  No new countries reported cases of 2019-nCoV in the past 24 hours.    \u2022  Update on Cruise Ship Diamond Princess:    On  9  February,  Japanese  National  Health  Authorities  provided  WHO  with  a  detailed update on the situation of the Cruise Ship Diamond Princess, currently  harboured in Yokohama, Japan. Following confirmation of a case of 2019-nCoV,  all crew and passengers are being quarantined for a 14-day period on board the  vessel, asked to stay in their cabins and to wear a mask when leaving their cabin.  All crew and passengers are closely followed-up and are medically examined and  tested for 2019-nCoV when displaying any signs or symptoms suggestive of 2019- nCoV  disease.  The  quarantine  period  will  come  to  an  end  on  19  February.  Epidemiological and environmental investigations are ongoing.   As of 8 February, 64 individuals were found to have been infected with 2019-nCoV  among  passengers  and  crew  members.  All  individuals  testing  positive  were  disembarked and admitted for medical care in infectious disease hospitals in the  Yokohama area. Close contacts of the infected passengers are asked to remain in  quarantine  for  14  days  from  last  contact  with  a  confirmed  case.

These materials must be easily  accessible in the languages of frontline responders. The WHO has rapidly developed and delivered two online  trainings to support the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak that are available on the open learning platform,  OpenWHO.org. The platform was established three years ago with emergencies such as 2019-nCoV in mind, in which  WHO would need to reach millions of people across the globe with real-time, accessible learning materials.    The courses currently available are:      1.  Emerging respiratory viruses, including 2019-nCoV: methods for detection, prevention, response and   control: https://openwho.org/courses/introduction-to-ncov   This course provides a general introduction to 2019-nCoV and emerging respiratory viruses and is intended  for public health professionals, incident managers and personnel working for the United Nations,  international organizations and NGOs. Approximately 26 000 people registered within the first 10 days of its  launch on 26 January. WHO teams are working to translate the resources into all WHO official languages and  Portuguese. Many countries have also initiated translation into their own local languages.      2.  WHO Critical Care Severe Acute Respiratory Infection course:  https://openwho.org/courses/severe-acute-  respiratory-infection   This course includes content on clinical management of patients with a severe acute respiratory infection.  Launched on 6 February, it enrolled 3500 users in its first 24 hours. The course is intended for clinicians who  are working in intensive care units in low- and middle-income countries and managing adult and pediatric  patients with severe forms of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection, including severe pneumonia, acute  respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock.        The following online learning courses are also in production in February: an occupational health and safety briefing  for respiratory diseases (ePROTECT); an introductory course on Go.Data (an outbreak investigation tool for field data  collection); an introduction to laboratory diagnostics and kits; and additional language versions of the published  courses.                  \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

The IPC global network is convened through weekly teleconferences with international IPC experts  to discuss technical aspects of IPC measures, share epidemiological updates and experiences regarding the IPC  measures put in place in affected countries. International participants are members of the Global Infection  Prevention and Control Network (GIPCN) or members of relevant institutions caring for infected 2019-nCoV acute  respiratory disease patients.    In consultation with the global IPC expert network, WHO has released three key IPC interim guidance materials.   These materials are available here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical- guidance    The first document - Infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)  infection is suspected. Interim guidance v2 - defines the following five IPC strategies to prevent or limit human to  human transmission in health care settings:   1.  Ensuring triage, early recognition, and source control (isolating patients with suspected 2019-nCoV   infection);    2.  Applying standard precautions for all patients;   3.   Implementing empiric additional precautions (droplet and contact and, whenever applicable, airborne  precautions) for suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection;   Implementing administrative controls;    4.  5.  Using environmental and engineering controls.   The second document - Home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection presenting  with mild symptoms and management of contacts. Guidance- v2 \u2013 provides recommendations in the context of  home care for mild patients.  Guidance is provided (i) for a household/caregiver\u2019s protection including which  personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear when caring for someone infected with 2019-nCoV and on  environmental and waste management; (ii) for an infected individual with mild disease, for example to wear a mask;  and (iii) for the management of contacts (including caregivers/health care workers) which includes 14 days of  monitoring of health for contacts.   The third document - Advice on the use of masks in the community, during home care and in health care settings in  the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. Interim guidance \u2013 v1. In community settings, medical  masks are not recommended for people without symptoms. For those who choose to wear medical masks,  appropriate mask management should be followed, which includes how to use and dispose of masks. Symptomatic  individuals are recommended to wear medical masks and seek early medical care if there are any signs of respiratory  distress.           \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019- nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   novel coronaviruses.    \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of   \fcountermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation.

WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce  the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:    \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially   in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their health care provider.    \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                       HIGHLIGHTS     Novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV)  Situation Report \u2013 18   Data as reported by 7 February 2020*                          \u2022  No new countries reported cases of 2019-nCoV in the past 24 hours.    \u2022  To date, a total of 72 States Parties were identified to be implementing travel   restrictions through official reports, official statements and the media.

The plan describes what we have learned so far about the virus and translates that  knowledge into strategic action that can guide the efforts of all national and international partners when developing  context-specific national and regional operational plans.    The overall goal of the strategic preparedness and response plan is to stop further transmission of 2019\u2011nCoV within  China and to other countries, and to mitigate the impact of the outbreak in all countries.      The strategic objectives of the plan are to:   \u2022   Limit human-to-human transmission, including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and  healthcare workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international  spread from China;  Identify, isolate, and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities, and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     These objectives can be achieved by:   A.  Rapidly establishing international coordination to deliver strategic, technical, and operational support   through existing mechanisms and partnerships;   B.  Scaling up country preparedness and response operations, including strengthening readiness to rapidly   identify, diagnose and treat cases; identification and follow-up of contacts when feasible (with priority given  to high-risk settings such as healthcare facilities); infection prevention and control in healthcare settings;  implementation of health measures for travelers; and awareness raising in the population through risk  communication and community engagement.   C.  Accelerating priority research and innovation to support a clear and transparent global process to set  research and innovation priorities to fast track and scale-up research, development, and the equitable  availability of candidate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics. This will build a common platform for  standardized processes, protocols and tools, to facilitate multidisciplinary and collaborative research  integrated with the response.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a  guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The  guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.    \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019- nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   novel coronaviruses.    \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread,   \fseverity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce  the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:     Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in   emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their healthcare provider.      \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                       HIGHLIGHTS     Novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV)  Situation Report - 15   Data as reported by 4 February 2020*                          \u2022  No new countries reported cases of 2019-nCoV in the 24 hours since the previous   situation report.

Amongst these activities, WHO OSL has updated the Disease Commodity Package  (DCP), which has been published here. This document provides guidance on commodities required for all aspects of  response. WHO OSL has also been working to develop global commodity cost estimates for the 2019-nCoV response,  which will aid in global strategic response planning and financing.           Working with technical experts in health operations, WHO OSL has developed a \u201c2019-nCoV kit\u201d, similar to prepared  treatment kits used for cholera, Ebola and other high threat pathogens in emergencies. In the coming days, the  costing, procurement and assembly of these kits will be a priority.     Through the Pandemic Supply Chain Network (PSCN), a market survey has been distributed to over 40 organizations  to understand the availability, distribution and forecasting of crucial response commodities throughout the world. A  report of the findings will be redistributed to all partners. The Network is exploring operational options within its  stakeholders to ensure in particular that critical personal protective equipment is secured and distributed to  appropriate locations. Additional stakeholders are encouraged to join the Pandemic Supply Chain Network by  contacting WHO OSL.     Guidance is currently under development for managing the logistics associated with case management, focusing on  isolation, triage and standard treatment centre configuration.    OSL is setting up a global supply chain system and a coordination mechanism between responders and suppliers to  ensure access to essential commodities for countries/populations most in need.          \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019- nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with  novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).   \u2022  WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,   medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   \u2022  WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   novel coronaviruses.    \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations    \f\u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated  regularly.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce  the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:     Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in   emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their healthcare provider.      \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                                       \u2022                                                    Novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV)  Situation Report - 13   Data as reported by 2 February 2020*                          HIGHLIGHTS     the last 24 hours.     \u2022  No new countries have reported cases of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease in   \u2022  WHO is receiving information about cases from a number of countries.

Due to the high demand for timely and trustworthy information about 2019-nCoV, WHO technical risk  communication and social media teams have been working closely to track and respond to myths and rumours.  Through its headquarters in Geneva, its six regional offices and its partners, the Organization is working 24 hours a  day to identify the most prevalent rumours that can potentially harm the public\u2019s health, such as false prevention  measures or cures. These myths are then refuted with evidence-based information. WHO is making public health  information and advice on the 2019-nCoV, including myth busters, available on its social media channels (including  Weibo, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest) and website.     Country risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) preparedness and response    Country risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) is a critical public health intervention in all  countries. Countries should prepare to communicate rapidly, regularly and transparently with the population. All  countries should prepare existing public health communication networks, media and community engagement staff  to be ready for a possible case, and for the appropriate response if this happens. Countries should coordinate  communications with other response organizations and include the community in response operations. WHO stands  ready to coordinate with partners to support countries in their communication and community engagement  response.    Ensuring a people-centered response to 2019-nCoV    An expanding group of global response organization such as the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the  International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) are coordinating efforts with WHO to ensure  that biomedical recommendations can be applied at the community level. These organizations are active at the  global, regional and country level to ensure that affected populations have a voice and are part of the response.  Ensuring that global recommendations and communication are tested, adapted and localized will help countries  better control the 2019-nCoV outbreak.                               \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

WHO is aware of possible transmission of 2019-nCoV  from infected people before they developed symptoms. Detailed exposure  histories are being taken to better understand the pre-clinical phase of infection  and how transmission may have occurred in these few instances. Asymptomatic  infection may be rare, and transmission from an asymptomatic person is very  rare with other coronaviruses, as we have seen with Middle East Respiratory  Syndrome coronavirus. Thus, transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely  not a major driver of transmission. Persons who are symptomatic will spread the  virus more readily through coughing and sneezing.    In China, 60.5% of all cases since the start of the outbreak have been reported  from Hubei Province (see further information under Technical Focus).    \u2022  Additional instances of human-to-human transmission outside China were   reported (see further information under Technical Focus).

The health worker treated two patients who were later identified as probable cases.     The first instance of third-generation human-to-human transmission outside China has been identified, in an  individual who was exposed to a confirmed case from the cluster in Bavaria, Germany.     For the first time, a case was exported from a country other than China: a patient was identified in South Korea  following their exposure in Japan to a confirmed case.     In the last 24 hours, additional instances of human-to-human transmission outside China were reported: in Japan, a  tour guide who is part of the same cluster of Japanese cases who had contact with tourists from Wuhan; in Germany,  a case that is part of the cluster in Bavaria; and in Thailand, a taxi driver who had no travel history to China.     Epidemiological link to Hubei Province    The outbreak of 2019-nCoV is still largely centered around Hubei Province.    In China, 60.5% of all cases since the start of the outbreak have been reported from Hubei Province.  The remaining  39.5% of cases have been reported from 33 provinces, regions and cities.  After Hubei Province, the second largest  number of cases has been reported from Zhejiang Province (599 cases).      Of the 132 cases identified outside China, 14 were due to secondary transmission outside China.  Of the remaining  cases, travel history is available for 101 of them:  all 101 had travelled to China in the 14 days before illness onset.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE    \u2022  WHO has actively sought misinformation and responded to rumours through \u2018myth busting\u2019 on WHO\u2019s social   media and its website.   \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019- nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement.   \u2022  Prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, medicines and   supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   \u2022  Activation of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   novel coronaviruses.    \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of   \fcountermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. The first protocol that is available is a:  Household transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, updated to take into  account the current situation.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce  the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:     Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in   emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their healthcare provider.      \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "Novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV)  Situation Report - 11   Data as reported by 31 January 2020*                      HIGHLIGHTS    \u2022   The  Emergency  Committee  on  the  novel  coronavirus  (2019-nCoV)  under  the  International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) was reconvened on 30 January. WHO  declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern.  The Emergency Committee has provided advice to WHO, to the People\u2019s Republic  of China, to all countries, and to the global community, on measures to control  this  outbreak.  The  Committee  believes  that  it  is  still possible  to  interrupt  virus  spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease  early,  isolate  and  treat  cases,  trace  contacts,  and  promote  social  distancing  measures  commensurate  with  the  risk.

To all countries    It is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country. Thus, all countries should be  prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact  tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoVinfection, and to share full data with WHO. Technical advice is  available on the WHO website.    Countries are reminded that they are legally required to share information with WHO under the IHR.     Any detection of 2019-nCoV in an animal (including information about the species, diagnostic tests, and relevant  epidemiological information) should be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as an emerging  disease.    Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and  international spread, and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and  collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing  research.      The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available.      Countries must inform WHO about travel measures taken, as required by the IHR. Countries are cautioned against  actions that promote stigma or discrimination, in line with the principles of Article 3 of the IHR.      \fThe Committee asked the Director-General to provide further advice on these matters and, if necessary, to make  new case-by-case recommendations, in view of this rapidly evolving situation.     To the global community    As this is a new coronavirus, and it has been previously shown that similar coronaviruses required substantial efforts  to enable regular information sharing and research, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity  and cooperation, in compliance with Article 44 of the IHR (2005), in supporting each other on the identification of  the source of this new virus, its full potential for human-to-human transmission, preparedness for potential  importation of cases, and research for developing necessary treatment.    Provide support to low- and middle-income countries to enable their response to this event, as well as to facilitate  access to diagnostics, potential vaccines and therapeutics.     Under Article 43 of the IHR, States Parties implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with  international traffic (refusal of entry or departure of international travellers, baggage, cargo, containers,  conveyances, goods, and the like, or their delay, for more than 24 hours) are obliged to send to WHO the public  health rationale and justification within 48 hours of their implementation. WHO will review the justification and may  request countries to reconsider their measures. WHO is required to share with other States Parties the information  about measures and the justification received.                                                                                                   \f", "valid": 0}, {"text": "                                  Novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV)  Situation Report - 10   Data as reported by 30 January 2020*                      HIGHLIGHTS    \u2022   The  Emergency  Committee  on  the  novel  coronavirus  (2019-nCoV)  under  the  International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) is meeting today to discuss whether  the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.

This name complies with the WHO Best Practices for  Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases, which were developed through a  consultative process among partner agencies. Endorsement for the interim name  is being sought from WHO\u2019s partner agencies, World Organization for Animal  Health (OIE) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The final name of the  disease will be provided by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). WHO  is also proposing \u20182019-nCoV\u2019 as an interim name of the virus.

This guidance includes advice on biosafety, patient sampling, and pathogen detection and  characterization. Like the epidemiologic situation, the diagnostic landscape is changing quickly. The first 2019-nCoV  cases were detected using metagenomic sequencing. Within days of obtaining the sequence data polymerase chain  reaction (PCR) assays were developed for clinical diagnostic use. Multiple academic and public-sector groups,  including China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have designed assays targeting areas of the  genome detecting sequences specific for the novel virus (2019-nCoV) and have made them publicly available.     One of WHO\u2019s main aims is to strengthen global diagnostic capacity for 2019-nCoV detection to improve  surveillance, early detection and track the spread of disease. To date, human- to- human transmission outside of  China has been limited, and public health efforts are targeted at limiting further transmission in countries with  imported cases which depends critically on the ability to detect the pathogen.     WHO has taken a three-pronged approach to enhance diagnostic capacity for 2019-nCoV:    1)  Forming a network of specialized referral laboratories with demonstrated expertise in the molecular  detection of coronaviruses. These international labs can support national labs to confirm 2019-nCoV  cases and troubleshoot their molecular assays;    2)  Strengthening national capacity for detection of 2019-nCoV so that diagnostic testing can be performed  rapidly without the need for overseas shipping. One way this has been achieved is through working with  existing global networks for detection of respiratory pathogens such as, notably, the National Influenza  Centers that support the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System;   3)  Ensuring test availability. This has involved a) screening of 2019-nCoV PCR protocols from academic   laboratories for validation data (e.g. limits of detection, specificity), b) looking for sequence alignment of  established commercial coronavirus assays (e.g. SARS) to see if any were likely to be able to detect 2019- nCoV with high sensitivity, and c) working with commercial and non-commercial agencies with capacity  to manufacture and distribute newly-developed 2019-nCoV PCR assays. WHO will begin supporting its  regional and country offices to make these tests available the first week of February 2020.                                        \f    SURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and  health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international  spread from China*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness- raising in the population and  risk communication.      \f    PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE        \u2022  WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the \u201cFirst Few X (FFX) Cases and contact   investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\u201d). The protocol is designed to gain an  early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019- nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health  guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.    \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and   in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,  infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel  coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement.   \u2022  Prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, medicines and   supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.    \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   \u2022  Activation of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   novel coronaviruses.    \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case  definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread,  severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of  countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. The first protocol that is available is a:  Household transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, updated to take into  account the current situation.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.       RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce  the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:     \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.   Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   \f\u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in   emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their healthcare provider.                                                                                                                            \f   Resources:  \u2022  Technical interim guidance for novel coronavirus, WHO:    https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019    \u2022  WHO travel advice for international travel and trade in relation to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus   2019-nCoV  https://www.who.int/ith/2020-24-01-outbreak-of-Pneumonia-caused-by-new-coronavirus/en/   \u2022  Readiness is the key to detect, combat spread of the new coronavirus:   https://www.who.int/southeastasia/news/detail/27-01-2020-readiness-is-the-key-to-detect-combat- spread-of-the-new-coronavirus   \u2022  WHO\u2019s Eastern Mediterranean Region scales up preparedness for novel coronavirus   http://www.emro.who.int/media/news/whos-eastern-mediterranean-region-scales-up-preparedness-for- novel-coronavirus.html    \u2022  Press statements by KCDC (in Korean):   https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&bid=0015    \u2022  Wuhan Municipal Health Commission's briefing on the pneumonia epidemic situation, (in Chinese):     http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/list2nd/no/710   \u2022  Disease outbreak news, Novel Coronavirus:   https://www.who.int/csr/don/en/    \u2022  Thailand Ministry of Public Health situation update on novel coronavirus (in Thai):   https://ddc.moph.go.th/viralpneumonia/index.html   \u2022  Press statement by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan (in Japanese):   https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/houdou/houdou_list_202001.html   \u2022  Notice sent out from Health and Food Safety Planning Division, Quarantine Station Operation   Management Office (in Japanese):  https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000582967.pdf  \u2022  Situation report by WHO on Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)   https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019   \u2022  CDC press release.

This document includes advice for individual  travelers on general measures to reduce the risk of acute respiratory infection, as well as advice on health measures  related to international traffic. Exit screening is advised for areas with ongoing transmission of the novel coronavirus  2019-nCoV (currently in People\u2019s Republic of China). Exit screening includes checking for signs and symptoms (fever  above 38\u00b0, cough), interview of passengers with respiratory infection symptoms leaving the affected areas with  regards to potential exposure to high-risk contacts or to the presumed animal source, directing symptomatic  travelers to further medical examination, followed by testing for 2019-nCoV, and keeping confirmed cases under  isolation and treatment. The evidence from the past outbreaks shows that effectiveness of entry screening is  uncertain, but it may support risk communication strategy by providing information to travellers from affected  countries/areas to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections, and to seek medical attention early if they  develop symptoms compatible with the infection.    During the current outbreak with the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, a number of exported cases were detected  through entry screening implemented by some countries. Symptomatic cases may be detected through temperature  screening at Point of Entry, for whom medical examination and laboratory tests will be conducted for confirmation.  Temperature screening to detect potential suspect cases at Point of Entry may miss travellers incubating the disease  or travellers concealing fever during travel and may require substantial investments. A focused approach targeting  direct flights from affected areas could be more effective and less resource demanding. If entry screening is  implemented, temperature screening should always be accompanied by dissemination of risk communication  messages at Points of Entry. This can be done through posters, leaflets or electronic bulletin aiming at raising  awareness among travellers about signs and symptoms of the disease, and encouragement of health care seeking  behavior, including when to seek medical care, and reporting of their travel history.    When implementing temperature screening, countries should take into account national policy and capacity  considerations. Countries implementing temperature screening are encouraged to establish proper mechanism for  data collection and analysis such as numbers of travellers screened and confirmed cases out of screened passengers,  and method of screening.      WHO advises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently  available on this event.                                           \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

Most seem to have mild disease,  and about 20% appear to progress to severe disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and in some cases  death.     Clinical care of suspected patients with 2019-nCoV should focus on early recognition, immediate isolation  (separation), implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and provision of  optimized supportive care. WHO is convening a bi-weekly call with clinical experts around the globe, to better  understand, in real-time, the clinical presentation and treatment interventions.      WHO has published interim clinical care guidance for hospitalized patients and for mildly ill patients at home, and  developed a standardized clinical case record form (CRF) that will be available the website. To facilitate the  aggregation of standardized clinical data, WHO is launching a Global 2019-nCoV Clinical Data Platform to allow  Member States to contribute anonymized clinical data in order to inform the public health clinical response. As there  is currently no known effective antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV, the WHO R&D blueprint is conducting a systematic  review to evaluate potential therapeutics and develop master clinical protocols that are necessary to accelerate this  globally.     WHO has also updated the Disease Commodity Package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,  medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.      In addition, a notification was sent out to the Emergency Medical Teams network requesting an expression of  interest for clinical operations support teams to support triage, referral systems, clinical care and IPC.                        \fSURVEILLANCE     Table 1.

For remaining  53 cases, information is available only for 36 cases as presented in the epi curve.          STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES    WHO\u2019s strategic objectives for this response are to:     \u2022   Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and  health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international  spread from China*;   Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;   \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment   options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;   \u2022  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;  \u2022  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.     *This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in  healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness- raising in the population and  risk communication.                       \fPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE        \u2022  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also   informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.   \u2022  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, clinical management, infection prevention and  control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus , risk communication  and community engagement.   \u2022  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.  \u2022  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel   \u2022  Activation of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.  \u2022  WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including   coronavirus 2019-nCoV.   novel coronaviruses.    \u2022  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new  virus. The data collected from the study protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and  case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand  spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for  implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. The first protocol that  is available is a: Household transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)  infection.   \u2022  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,   epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the  disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, updated to take into  account the current situation.   \u2022  WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,   clinical management and mathematical modelling.     RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE    During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and  fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce  the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:     Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover   coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in   emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory  illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history  with their healthcare provider. Travel guidance was updated on 24 January.        \f               Resources:  \u2022  Technical interim guidance for novel coronavirus, WHO:    https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019    \u2022  WHO travel advice for international travel and trade in relation to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus   2019-nCoV   \u2022  https://www.who.int/ith/2020-24-01-outbreak-of-Pneumonia-caused-by-new-coronavirus/en/   \u2022  Readiness is the key to detect, combat spread of the new coronavirus:   https://www.who.int/southeastasia/news/detail/27-01-2020-readiness-is-the-key-to-detect-combat- spread-of-the-new-coronavirus   \u2022  WHO\u2019s Eastern Mediterranean Region scales up preparedness for novel coronavirus   http://www.emro.who.int/media/news/whos-eastern-mediterranean-region-scales-up-preparedness-for- novel-coronavirus.html    \u2022  Press statements by KCDC (in Korean):   https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&bid=0015    \u2022  Wuhan Municipal Health Commission's briefing on the pneumonia epidemic situation, (in Chinese):     http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/list2nd/no/710   \u2022  Disease outbreak news, Novel Coronavirus:   https://www.who.int/csr/don/en/    \u2022  Thailand Ministry of Public Health situation update on novel coronavirus (in Thai):   https://ddc.moph.go.th/viralpneumonia/index.html   \u2022  Press statement by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan (in Japanese):   https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/houdou/houdou_list_202001.html   \u2022  Notice sent out from Health and Food Safety Planning Division, Quarantine Station Operation   Management Office (in Japanese):  https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000582967.pdf  \u2022  Situation report by WHO on Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)   https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019   \u2022  CDC press release.

WHO awaits further information from  Chinese officials.     5   \fCurrent estimates of the incubation period range from 2-10 days, and these estimates will be refined  as more data become available. Understanding the time when infected patients may transmit the  virus to others is critical for control efforts. In previous outbreaks of other coronavirus, such as  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), some individuals can be asymptomatic  and transmit to others. Detailed epidemiological information from more people infected is needed  to determine the infectious period of 2019-nCoV.    WHO has issued advice to people on how to protect themselves from 2019-nCoV infection, as for  any virus that spreads via the respiratory route: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel- coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public   In addition, it is vitally important in health care settings, that health care workers are able to protect  themselves from infection.  WHO guidance on infection prevention and control measures in health  care facilities is here: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control- during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected               The strategic objectives of the response are to interrupt the transmission of the virus from one  person to another in China, to prevent exportation of cases from China to other countries and  territories, and to prevent further transmission from exported case if they were to happen. This can  be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis  and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and  control in healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness raising  in the population, risk communication.   During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)  and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human to human transmission occurred  through droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV  can be similar.  The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory  infections include the following:     Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.   \u2022  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.  \u2022  \u2022  Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  \u2022  People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain   distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).   \u2022  Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in   hospitals, especially in emergency departments.   WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms  suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, the travellers are encouraged to seek  medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider. Travel guidance was  77updated on 24 January.      6   \fIII. COUNTRY RESPONSE:   China:   \u2022  Public education on disease prevention and environmental hygiene further strengthened in   public places across the city, farmers\u2019 markets in particular.

As of 23 January, China reported  cases in 25 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities). Twenty five percent of confirmed  cases reported by China have been classified by Chinese health authorities as seriously ill (from  Wubei Province: (16% severely ill, 5% critically ill, and 4% having died).    Currently, cases infected in China have been exported to the US, Thailand, Japan and Republic of  Korea. It is expected that more cases will be exported to other countries, and that further  transmission may occur.   The initial source of 2019-nCoV still remains unknown. However, it is clear the growing outbreak is  no longer due to ongoing exposures at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan; as in the last one  week, less than 15% of new cases reported having visited Huanan market. There is now more  evidence that 2019-nCoV spreads from human- to- human and also across generations of  cases.  Moreover, family clusters involving persons with no reported travel to Wuhan have been                                                               1 The situation report includes information reported to WHO Geneva by 10 AM CET  2 Severe illness: According to any of the following criteria:  (1) dyspnea; (2) respiratory rate more than 30 bpm; (3) hypoxemia; (4) chest X-ray with multi-lobar infiltrates or pulmonary   infiltration progressed more than 50% within 24 - 48 hours.   1   \freported from Guangdong Province.

On  21 January 2020, US CDC activated its Emergency Response System to better provide ongoing  support to the 2019-nCoV response. On 21 January 2020, US CDC again updated its interim  travel health notice for persons traveling to Wuhan city, China. The travel notice was raised  from Level 1; Practice Usual Precautions, to a Level 2: Practice Enhanced Precautions advising  travellers  that  preliminary  information  suggests  that  older  adults  with  underlying  health  conditions may be at increased risk for severe disease.   \u2022  CDC began entry screening of passengers on direct and connecting flights from Wuhan China  to the  3  main  ports  of  entry  in  the  United  States  on  17  January  2020  and  will expand  the  screening to Atlanta and Chicago in the coming days.    \u2022  CDC issued an updated interim Health Alert Notice (HAN) Advisory to inform state and local   health departments and health care providers about this outbreak on 17 January 2020.   \u2022  A  CDC  team  has  deployed  a  team  to  support  the  ongoing  investigation  in  the  state  of  Washington in response to the first reported case of 2019-nCoV in the United States, including  potentially tracing close contacts to determine if anyone else has become ill.   \u2022  CDC has developed a rRT-PCR test that can diagnose 2019-nCoV.    IV. Statistical Modelling   WHO is working with a number of mathematical model groups to better understand the  epidemiology and transmission dynamics of this event.    \u2022  Phylogenetic analysis suggests based on 23 full genome sequences submitted to GISAID, that   the sequences exhibit little genetic variation, which is indicative of a recent origin of the  sampled and sequenced viruses. The sequenced genomes show no evidence of additional  introductions of the virus from a non-human animal reservoir, although the numbers of  sequences are limited at present.
