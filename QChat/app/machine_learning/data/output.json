    {"text": "At least 170 people have died as a result of the outbreak of a new coronavirus, The number of confirmed cases of the virus in China has risen to 7,711 and infections have been reported in at least 15 other countries. But not only has the virus spread, so too has misinformation. Numerous conspiracies have appeared since the outbreak - not to mention dubious health advice. The BBC Monitoring team has been taking a look at where these have all come from. False health advice As the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak continues to rise, social-media users have been sharing advice on ways to treat or prevent the disease. But at least some of the tips have proved to be misleading or false. One such claim - shared 16,000 times on Facebook - advises users in the Philippines to 'keep your throat moist', avoid spicy food and 'load up on vitamin C' in order to prevent the disease.The information is said to be from the country's Department of Health but it does not match the advice on the DOH website or its official press releases on the outbreak. Journalists and fact-checkers have found posts with identical or slightly altered wording - said to be from local health authorities - are also being circulated on Facebook and WhatsApp in Canada, Pakistan and India. As was the case with the Philippines, the advice does not match the information provided by health officials in those countries. Another unsubstantiated claim shared online suggests avoiding cold or preserved food and drinks, such as ice cream and milkshakes, for 'at least 90 days'. One of the first to share this advice was a Facebook page called ForChange. It accompanied the post with a video of a parasite being removed from a person's lips, suggesting the procedure was somehow related to the new coronavirus. But, as Altnews fact-checkers pointed out, the video is in fact three months old and unrelated to the virus. Facebook has since marked the ForChange post as 'false information' but dozens of identical messages are still being circulated on the platform. The World Health Organization's official advice for the public on the new coronavirus suggests only avoiding consuming 'raw or undercooked animal products'. There is currently no vaccine against the virus but standard recommendations to prevent infections apply. These include:    regular hand washing      covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing or, failing that, with the crook of your arm thoroughly cooking meat and eggs avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or fever. Bat soup videos From the very beginning people speculated online about the origin of the coronavirus. This was exacerbated by a slew of videos said to be showing Chinese people eating bats amid the deadly outbreak in Wuhan. One such clip shows a smiling Chinese woman holding a cooked bat on camera, before admitting it tastes 'like chicken meat'. The video prompted outrage online, with some users blaming Chinese eating habits for the outbreak. But the video was not shot in Wuhan, or in China for that matter. Originally filmed in 2016, it shows popular blogger and travel show host Mengyun Wang during a trip to Palau, an archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean. The clip resurfaced on social media after cases of the new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan late last year. Following online backlash, Ms Wang apologised, saying she was 'just trying to introduce the life of local people' to the audience and had not known that bats could be a virus carrier. Her video has since been taken down. The new coronavirus is believed to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan. Although bats have been named in recent research from China as a possible source of the virus, bat soup is not particularly commonplace in the country and the investigations into its exact origins continue. Coronavirus: How worried should we be? China coronavirus: A visual guide Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemic‎? Outbreak 'planned' As the United States reported its first case of the coronavirus last week, several patent documents started to circulate on Twitter and Facebook that at first glance appear to suggest experts have been aware of the virus for years. One of the first users to float these allegations was conspiracy theorist and YouTuber Jordan Sather. In a lengthy thread that has been retweeted thousands of times, he shared a link to a 2015 patent filed by the Pirbright Institute in Surrey, England, that talks about developing a weakened version of coronavirus for potential use as a vaccine to prevent or treat respiratory diseases. The same link has also been widely circulated on Facebook, mainly in conspiracy and anti-vaccination groups. Sather used the fact that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a donor to both Pirbright and vaccine development to suggest that the current outbreak virus has somehow been deliberately manufactured to attract funding for the development of a vaccine. 'And how much funding has the Gates Foundation given to vaccine programs throughout the years? Was the release of this disease planned? Is the media being used to incite fear around it?' Sather tweeted. But Pirbright's patent is not for the new coronavirus. Instead, it covers the avian infectious bronchitis virus, a member of the wider coronavirus family that infects poultry. As for the speculation about the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Pirbright spokeswoman Teresa Maughan told Buzzfeed News that the institute's particular work with the infectious bronchitis virus was not funded by this foundation.", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "'Bioweapon' conspiracies Another baseless claim that has gone viral online suggests the virus was part of China's 'covert biological weapons programme' and may have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Many accounts pushing the theory cite two widely-shared Washington Times articles both of which quote a former Israeli military intelligence officer for the claim. However, no evidence is provided for the claim in the two articles, and the Israeli source is quoted as saying that 'so far there isn't evidence or indication' to suggest there was a leak. The two articles have so far been posted to hundreds of different social accounts to a potential audience of millions. The Daily Star published a similar piece last week, claiming the virus might have 'started in a secret lab'. However, it has since amended the piece to add there is no evidence for the claim. BBC News approached the Washington Times for comment.", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "'Spy team' Another claim inaccurately linked the virus to the suspension of a researcher at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory. Virologist Dr Xiangguo Qiu, her husband and some of her students from China were removed from the lab following a possible 'policy breach,' according to a report by Canada's national broadcaster CBC last year. Police told CBC News there was 'no threat to public safety'. Another report said Dr Qiu had visited the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences twice a year for two years. A tweet with more than 12,000 retweets and 13,000 likes - claimed without evidence that Dr Qiu and her husband were a 'spy team', had sent 'pathogens to the Wuhan facility', and that her husband 'specialised in coronavirus research'. None of the three claims in the tweet can be found in the two CBC reports and the terms 'coronavirus' and 'spy' do not appear even once in either. CBC has since reported that these claims are baseless. 'Wuhan nurse video' Different versions of a 'whistleblower' video, alleged to have been taken by a 'doctor' or a 'nurse' in Hubei province, have racked up million views on various social media platforms and mentioned in numerous online reports. The most popular version was uploaded to YouTube by a Korean user, and included English and Korean subtitles - the video has since been taken down. According to the English subtitles, the woman is a nurse in a Wuhan hospital. However, she does not claim to be either a nurse or a doctor in the video at all. This seems to be merely an assumption on the part of those who have uploaded various versions of the video to social media. The woman, who does not identify herself, is wearing protective suit in an unknown location. However, her suit and mask do not match the ones worn by medical staff in Hubei. Due to a lockdown being enforced by the authorities, it is difficult to verify videos from the province. But she makes a number of unsubstantiated claims about the virus, making it unlikely for her to be a nurse or a paramedic. She also claims the virus has a 'second mutation', which can infect up to 14 people. But the World Health Organization has preliminarily estimated the number of infections an individual carrying the virus can cause is 1.4 to 2.5 'She doesn't sound like someone from [a] medical professional background,' Muyi Xiao, a Wuhan native and the visuals editor for the ChinaFile online magazine, told the BBC. Although the exact location of the video is unknown, it is likely that the woman is a Hubei resident sharing her personal opinion about the outbreak. 'I think there is [a] possibility that she thinks she is telling the truth. Because no one knows the truth,' Badiucao, a Chinese political activist currently based in Australia, told the BBC. 'No transparency [has] just left people guessing and panicking.'", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "Bat soup, dodgy cures and 'diseasology': the spread of coronavirus misinformation From fake alerts over no-go suburbs to pro-Trump conspiracy theories, crackpot stories and dangerous advice have gone viral Fake news and conspiracy theories about the origin of the coronavirus have swiftly followed the outbreak around the world. The quick spread of the virus from its origins in China’s Hubei province, and the lack of early detail about where it comes from or how to treat it, has provided ample room for speculation. One week after the city of Wuhan was placed under effective lockdown, the tide of misinformation is so high that Twitter, Facebook, and Google are struggling to cope. On Friday, after the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency, Facebook said it would “remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organisations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them”. On Thursday, Twitter announced it would “adjust search prompt in key countries across the globe to feature authoritative health sources when you search for terms related to novel #coronavirus.” Here are some of the examples of misinformation spreading around the world. 1. People eating bats in Wuhan The biggest piece of misinformation about the cause of the virus is the widely circulated video of a woman eating a bat. It has been spread by the Daily Mail, RT and far-right YouTuber Paul Joseph Watson among others. The Chinese celebrity Wang Mengyun said she has received death threats since the video went viral this month. The origins of the coronavirus are believed to have been from illegally sold wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan, and bats could potentially have been the source, but the video was not filmed in a Wuhan restaurant as some had claimed, but in Palau, Micronesia, for a travel video in 2016. 2. It’s a deliberate plot Proponents of the QAnon conspiracy theory, such as Jordan Sather, have been spreading the idea that the outbreak of the coronavirus was timed to coincide with the start of Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. Sather claimed in a thread posted to his 100,000 followers that the disease was planned and manufactured. He pointed to a coronavirus patent granted to a firm with ties to the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation. The firm, Pirbright, had to issue a statement correcting misinformation. The firm said it researches infectious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus that infects poultry and pigs – not humans. 3. It’s a bioweapon The Washington Times claimed in a story that the coronavirus outbreak could be linked to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, quoting a former Israeli military intelligence officer who claimed a bioweapon was one possible option. Other conspiracy theories have suggested the virus was smuggled out of Canada into China. The Washington Post, however, spoke to a number of experts who said based on the virus genome there is no indication it was engineered. The MIT professor Vipin Narang said in a tweet that there is no evidence it is a bioweapon, and if it were, it would be a bad one, because a good bioweapon should be more deadly but not as easily spread. 4. 5G caused the spread of coronavirus These days 5G is blamed for everything, from cancer to bushfires, so it is not surprising that conspiracy theories that 5G caused, or helped spread coronavirus have been shared into the anti-5G groups on Facebook. One post debunked on Facebook claimed Wuhan was where 5G was first rolled out, and 5G “wrecked immune systems and thereby boosted the virulency of the normal cold”. Wuhan was one of a few places where 5G was rolled out in China in 2020, along with other parts of the world. There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans. 5. Just take oregano oil, vitamin C or salt water Prominent anti-vaxxers and natural medicine groups have been sharing posts suggesting oregano oil, vitamin C, and salt water are either good ways to prevent coronavirus or cure it. They will not. 6. Just drink bleach One of the more dangerous remedies again comes from prominent QAnon conspiracy followers, with Daily Beast reporting the pro-Trump conspiracy theorists have told people to buy their “miracle mineral solution” that is supposed to cure everything, including autism or HIV/AIDS. The Food and Drug Administration has said the solution is “a dangerous bleach”. 7. Chinese Red Bull and fortune cookies are virus carriers There have been various viral posts on social media all trying to appear to be an official health-related update about what people should do to try to prevent them from getting in contact with the coronavirus. One of the most prominent spread in Australia, via childcare centres, is an apparent “urgent notice” from the “Department of Diseasology Parramatta”. ", "valid": 0},
    {"text": " This non-existent department warned of food that could be contaminated including wuxhang rice, fortune cookies, migoreng noodles, Yakult, and Chinese Red Bull. The New South Wales health department was forced to issue a statement stating there was no such entity as the Department of Diseasology Parramatta. “NSW Health would like to assure the community that the locations mentioned in this post pose no risk to visitors, and there have been no ‘positive readings’ at train stations.” 8. The no-go suburbs Another warning spread on social media claims to come from Queensland Health and warns people to stay away from certain suburbs in Brisbane and any populated areas that have a certain proportion of Chinese residents. The Brisbane MP Duncan Pegg tweeted that the warning was fake and designed to malign the community.

    {"text": "The best way to prevent the novel coronavirus? Eating garlic. Or actually, try traditional Chinese medicine. In case you hadn’t heard, a vaccine already exists but the United States won’t share it. Wait a second, the coronavirus doesn’t exist at all, it’s all a conspiracy. How did I hear all of these theories, which to be clear, have no basis in reality? From my mum, circulated in her numerous WhatsApp groups. The same groups told her that the novel coronavirus came from Chinese people eating bat soup (spoiler alert: it didn’t). It was only weeks later that she asked me if the United States military had brought the virus to China (also untrue). The global pandemic that has killed thousands and closed borders is awash with disinformation. The World Health Organization declared an “infodemic”, an over-abundance of information – some accurate and some not – that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the Munich Security Conference in February: “Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous.” Much like globalisation has extended the reach of the virus, social media has extended the reach of fake news. And the stakes are higher. Disinformation in a pandemic is not new. Operation Infektion was an information warfare campaign by the KGB to spread the rumour in the 1980s that HIV/AIDS was a misfired American biological weapon. Throughout history, scared people have latched onto information that made them feel safe – regardless of whether it was true or not. But this pandemic is different to any other. None of us are bystanders in this crisis. And more people are at home, more people are online, and more people asking the same questions. The dilution of information on the internet is currently posing a risk to global health and safety. Much like globalisation has extended the reach of the virus, social media has extended the reach of fake news. And the stakes are higher. During an outbreak, people need to be encouraged to do the right thing to control a disease or mitigate its impact. “It is not only information to make sure people are informed,” according to the WHO’s Sylvie Briand, “it is also making sure people are informed to act appropriately.” Much of the misinformation spread online has been unintentional. Malign actors are taking advantage of the environment of fear and confusion. A US State Department official reportedly told Congress that Russia was taking the opportunity to sow discord and panic in Western countries and undermine officials in the public eye. “The entire ecosystem of Russian disinformation is at play,” she said. An accompanying report found that nearly two million tweets over a three-week period had disseminated conspiracy theories about the coronavirus overseas. In this crisis not only is there an absence of clear and credible information from authorities that people trust, but state actors are filling the void irresponsibly. Politicians, officials and state-owned media, and even heads of state, have been elevating disinformation. One of the China’s official spokespeople tweeted a fake video of Italians singing “Grazie, Cina!” as China’s national anthem, “March of the Volunteers”, played in the background. For what it’s worth, many similar videos have falsely shown quarantined Italians singing Katy Perry’s “Roar” or Madonna’s “I Rise” in solidarity. Another Chinese government spokesperson has doubled down on the rumour that the virus was brought to China by America, which is now being reported in Chinese state media. Russian media have also suggested that Covid-19 was created in a US laboratory in Georgia. Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro has said the virus is a possible bioweapon targeting China. Trains are disinfected for Covid-19 at Seoul Station, Seoul (Republic of Korea/Flickr) Many elected leaders in the United States have been similarly irresponsible. President Donald Trump has consistently misrepresented the scale and response to the coronavirus in the United States. He has disputed the mortality rate. He has claimed the coronavirus is no worse than a flu. He has circulated inaccurate medical advice. Some media organisations had also spread misinformation of this nature, although most have since changed their tune as the number of infections in the United States skyrockets. American politicians have also pushed the conspiracy that the virus originated in a lab in China. Technology companies appear to be taking the challenge seriously, with some success. YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook have each made commitments to cleanse their sites of disinformation using existing tools, while working with the WHO to direct users to credible advice. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg posted: As our community standards make clear, it’s not okay to share something that puts people in danger. We’re removing false claims and conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organisations. Wikipedia’s approach has been to apply more stringent rules, rather than existing standards, with better results. Moderating public platforms is only a fraction of the challenge. All of my mum’s inaccurate information was circulated on WhatsApp, the world’s most-popular messaging app, with 1.6 billion active users. Others such as Facebook Messenger and China’s WeChat both have over a billion users. These are effectively a locked box for content moderators. These platforms were already struggling with the daily deluge of fake news. Now they also need to figure out how to respond to senior government figures using their platforms to spread lies.

    {"text": "Quick Take Multiple social media posts are spreading a bogus conspiracy theory about the deadly Wuhan virus. The posts falsely claim that the virus has been patented and a vaccine is already available. That’s not true; the patents the posts refer to pertain to different viruses. Full Story Following the outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and the announcement of the first American case on Jan. 21, several groups and individuals are circulating false rumors on Facebook about the mystery pathogen. Numerous posts claim the virus has been patented — and some even suggest, incorrectly, that the virus was made in a lab and a vaccine already exists. “The new fad disease called the ‘coronavirus’ is sweeping headlines,” one Facebook post, taken from Twitter, reads. “Funny enough, there was a patent for the coronavirus was filed in 2015 and granted in 2018.” Another, which was shared by others, and is part of a series of false coronavirus posts, proclaims that the virus is “‘new’ yet it was lab created and patented in 2015 (in development since 03’).” Yet another proposes a similar conspiracy. “So.. patent on this ‘new’ Corona virus expired on the 22nd, today,” the post says. “We have a sudden outbreak. There’s magically already a vaccine available.” In fact, there is no vaccine yet available for the new coronavirus, which for now goes by the unwieldy moniker of 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV. And there is no patent related to the new virus, either. All of the posts link to patents that are related to two different viruses in the coronavirus family. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that tend to cause respiratory illnesses in humans and a variety of other illnesses in animals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains on its website. The name comes from the crown, or corona-like appearance of infective viruses when seen under a microscope. One patent is for a genetic sequence of the virus that causes SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease that spread to dozens of countries in 2003, sickening more than 8,000 people and killing 774. “The sequencing was done at the CDC during the SARS outbreak and they were the ones that filed the patent,” Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland, explained in an email. The CDC told the Associated Press in 2003 that the agency was claiming ownership to ensure access, and to prevent others from controlling the technology. In a phone interview, Columbia law professor Harold Edgar told us that following a U.S. Supreme Court case decided in 2013, U.S. patent law no longer allows for patents on viral sequences as they exist in nature. The other supposedly related patent is for a mutated form of avian infectious bronchitis virus, or IBV, which infects poultry, but not people. The patent was filed by the Pirbright Institute, a research institute in the U.K. whose mission is to prevent and control “viral diseases of livestock.” The mutations were created to attenuate, or weaken, the virus, so that it could be used as a vaccine to protect chickens from the disease. “Neither of these has anything to do with the new 2019-nCoV virus,” said Frieman. “This is clearly a bogus theory that this virus was created in a lab, patented and has a vaccine already made to it.” Researchers are still working to understand the origin, spread and severity of the latest coronavirus. The outbreak began in early December in Wuhan, a city of around 11 million people in central China. Evidence suggests the virus likely spilled over to humans from an as-yet-unidentified animal, as has happened in the past for other coronaviruses. The SARS virus, for instance, is thought to have come from bats, and then spread to humans through civets, a cat-like animal eaten as a delicacy in Asia. The SARS virus then proved to be transmissible from person to person. A similar story played out in 2012 with the virus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, which may also have originated in bats, and then spread to humans via camel. Cases of the new respiratory illness were first reported in people who had connections to a fish market in Wuhan that also sold a variety of live animals. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci told Scientific American on Jan. 22 that the new virus “almost certainly” came from an animal. It is now clear that the new coronavirus can also pass from person to person, although it is not known how easily it spreads. It’s possible the disease may not be as severe as SARS, but health officials say it is too early to know for sure. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. As of early Jan. 24, at least 26 people have died, all in China, out of nearly 900 confirmed cases worldwide. Deaths have primarily occurred in older people or those who had other health conditions. Cases have also been reported in Thailand, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. The U.S. patient had recently traveled from Wuhan and is in good condition, according to the CDC. As for a vaccine, the CDC says it is already working on one with the NIH, but that it is still early in the process. Fauci explained in his Scientific American interview that the agency is partnering with Moderna, a biotech company, to create a messenger RNA-based vaccine. “We will likely have a candidate in early phase I trials for safety in about three months,” he said. “That doesn’t mean we will have a vaccine ready for use in three months; even in an emergency, that would take a year or more. But we’re already on it.” So while efforts have begun to make a vaccine, in part thanks to Chinese researchers who have already shared the sequence of the new virus, it is not true that a vaccine already exists — just as claims that the virus previously had a patent and was manufactured in a lab are also false.

    {"text": "Be Wary of Those Texts From a Friend of a Friend’s Aunt Text messages claiming to have inside knowledge were the latest example of misinformation spreading amid anxiety about the coronavirus.", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "March 16, 2020 The text messages have largely followed a pattern: The author claims to have a connection to someone working at a clinic or government agency — an aunt, a neighbor, a friend’s cousin — who has revealed unannounced plans for an impending lockdown or quarantine. They’re passing along a warning, telling recipients of the urgent need to stockpile food, gas, medicine or other necessities. They often contain pleas that they be forwarded to others. And none of them are true. The texts are sometimes laced with elements of truth, making their false conclusions seem plausible, especially as every passing hour seems to bring a dramatic shift to the way the coronavirus is changing our everyday lives. The latest such message spread on Sunday, prompting an announcement from the National Security Council: “Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE,” it said in a tweet on Sunday, just before midnight. “There is no national lockdown.” With the rapid spread of the coronavirus across the world, misinformation has followed suit. Other messages in recent weeks, reflecting the same pattern, have warned that New York City public transit would shut down last week (it’s still running), or that the entire Pacific Northwest would be quarantined last week (also not true). At least one message said that President Trump would declare a national emergency within three days — Mr. Trump declared the emergency on Friday, but that did not give him the power to impose a national quarantine. The World Health Organization has warned of an “infodemic” and is trying to fight rumors and falsehoods on the internet about the coronavirus. Social media companies like Facebook and Twitter are racing to remove misinformation about the virus from their platforms, often unsuccessfully. Text messages are a particular problem. Text messages, however, can pose a particular problem, said Graham Brookie, the director and managing editor of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council. He said text messages are usually a trusted medium, in part because the sender needs to know the recipient’s phone number. They cannot be as easily forwarded as messages on other social media, like WhatsApp messages or Facebook posts. “It’s a little bit more intentional,” he said. By sourcing information to a relative or friend of a friend, the messages appear to be conversational and accessible while maintaining a “facade of credibility,” he said. The disinformation follows a familiar playbook used on other social media, old-fashioned chain letters and emails: asking the recipient to forward the message to others, Mr. Brookie said. “It’s the latest version of that threat,” he said. “It’s not something that is new, but it is something that is effective.” The goal is not clear. It’s not immediately clear who was responsible for the mass text messages on Sunday, or any of the others, according to Mr. Brookie, who was an adviser at the council until 2017. Text messages are hard to track, because data about them, kept by companies like AT&T or Verizon, is not necessarily accessible to the public, he said. One of the few ways to track text messages is through crowdsourced reports on social media. “We don’t know where they are coming from, which is one of the main vulnerabilities here,” Mr. Brookie said. “It could be anything from your everyday scammer to a hostile nation-state.” At an afternoon news conference on Monday, Mr. Trump said while regional lockdowns or quarantines may be possible, he was not considering a similar nationwide measure. Asked if the rumors were part of a foreign disinformation campaign, Mr. Trump said he could not say, adding that the media had been “very fair.” “It could be that you have some foreign groups that are playing games, but it doesn’t matter,” he said. And not knowing where the messages are coming from also makes it harder to ascertain the goal of the messages. Because the messages are urging people to stockpile goods, the goal could be financial gain, Mr. Brookie said. Or it could be to stoke chaos and confusion across the country, he added. What can people do about it? Mr. Brookie said people receiving text messages about the coronavirus should verify the source of the message as well as the source’s source. He said people should check for biases in the message. “Does something feel like it’s trying to scare you?” he said. “Is it claiming it has all the facts while others don’t? Is it jumping to conclusions that you haven’t seen in other places? Is it using rhetorical tools in order to persuade you of something?” He added, “if it’s not pointing to the latest, verified science-based information, like coronavirus.gov, then absolutely think twice about it.” The government also had the ability to text people directly through a warning system, if it chose to, he said. “There’s no indication that that system has been used in response to the coronavirus,” he said. Pay attention to what the official sources are telling you. “If it’s not coming from my mouth, don’t believe it,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday, trying to calm rumors. Trust in institutions is down. Public officials should play an active role in combating rumors and disinformation, he said. Still, many have questioned how much official government channels can be trusted. Mr. Trump has been criticized for playing down the outbreak in the early stages and repeatedly making assertions — including about the accessibility of tests — that were either overstated or inaccurate. Over all, trust in institutions is down, Mr. Brookie said. “We’re facing this challenge of disinformation about coronavirus already on a back foot because of diminished trust in our institutions,” he said.", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "Facebook doubles down on removing coronavirus conspiracy theories Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok are all battling misinformation related to the novel coronavirus. Social media companies are increasing their vigilance about removing coronavirus conspiracies. Facebook, in particular, continues to update its policies as the outbreak — and corresponding disinformation — spreads. On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg reiterated in a Facebook post that the platform was removing conspiracy theories related to the coronavirus that have been flagged by global health organizations, in addition to labeling coronavirus misinformation with “fact check” labels to let users know that such content had been rated false. Zuckerberg also said that Facebook is providing the World Health Organization (WHO) “as many free ads as they need.” At the same time, Zuckerberg said the company will block ads that try to exploit the situation, such as those that claim a product has a miracle cure for the Covid-19 disease. It’s been more than two months since a novel strain of coronavirus popped up in Wuhan, China, and proceeded to spread to countries across the world. And as that’s happened, panic has continued to disseminate throughout social media, forcing tech platforms to grapple with what the World Health Organization is calling an “infodemic.” As of March 4, the novel coronavirus linked to Wuhan, China, has infected nearly 95,000 people, mostly in mainland China, and there are cases popping up throughout the United States. More than 3,200 people have died, though researchers at Johns Hopkins tracking the disease also report more than 51,000 recoveries from the illness. With more and more people searching online for information about the coronavirus outbreak, they can easily encounter a barrage of misleading and potentially dangerous information. And the WHO, which has also released its own “myth-busting” resources, is warning that misinformation about the novel coronavirus has caused harmful stigmatization and discrimination. In the US, for instance, there is a growing number of reports about misinformation fueling racism against Asian Americans. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok have all told Recode that they’ve been working to promote factual content and some are limiting the reach of posts with misinformation on their platforms. Twitter, for instance, has put a warning label linking to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) when users search “coronavirus.” Meanwhile, the WHO has now joined TikTok in an effort to boost accurate information about the illness, and several of those companies met with the public health organization at Facebook back in February. The CDC and the WHO recommend several basic measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects. Stay home when you are sick. Contact a health worker if you have symptoms; fever and a dry cough are most common. DON’T touch your face. DON’T travel if you have a fever and cough.DON’T wear a face mask if you are well. Guidance may change. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s guide to Covid-19. Still, efforts by these social media platforms have not managed to stop the spread of misleading or outright false hoaxes about the outbreak in the form of posts and videos that have racked up thousands of clicks, “Likes,” and shares. A significant amount of false information about the coronavirus is also spreading on private channels. Take WhatsApp, for instance. As the Washington Post reported, the encrypted platform has seen a flurry of wrong information about the coronavirus, creating panic among its users throughout the world. Another problem involves politicians promoting the idea that the coronavirus is a hoax or spreading other conspiracy theories about the virus. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed to Recode that the company would remove false claims and conspiracy theories flagged by world health organizations that have been shared by politicians or elected officials. While we’re seeing a wide variety of false coronavirus posts across these platforms, it’s still hard to say how widespread the misinformation problem is. But it’s significant enough that well-regarded institutions, including Johns Hopkins University, research centers in England, and even NASA have had to issue statements or comments debunking claims that have been floated online. Advocacy groups such as Media Matters have also been busy tracking down false and misleading posts. Although there is a seemingly endless stream of sources spreading misinformation about the Wuhan coronavirus around the web, we’ve identified and debunked a few of the most pervasive hoaxes. False: The novel coronavirus sickness is caused by 5G On social media, some are pushing the idea that the novel coronavirus was caused by or can be linked to deployment of 5G technology in Wuhan, China. There are several “strains” of this theory floating around online. One premise is that 5G technology can weaken the immune system and make the common cold more virulent. Another promotes the idea that the 5G technology itself is causing the symptoms that have been attributed to the novel coronavirus. One version of the theory pushes the idea that the technology absorbs oxygen in the lungs, which “causes coronavirus.”", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "That idea has been flagged false by a UK-based third-party fact-checker, called Full Fact, that works with Facebook. There’s no evidence that 5G impacts the immune system, and no proof that it has any link to the novel coronavirus. False: There’s a plot to “exterminate” people infected with the new coronavirus On social media, some have floated the claim that China sought permission from the country’s Supreme Court to kill people infected with the novel coronavirus. Several fact-checkers, including Snopes, have determined these reports to be false and to have originated from a website with several “red flags.”", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "Poynter observed that some social media accounts continue to push the idea that China is planning to kill people with the illness. Meanwhile, some accounts have floated that the idea that the incineration of human bodies is causing an excess of sulfur dioxide, which they imply can be seen from satellite images. There is no evidence that any of this is true, and a research meteorologist from NASA told the UK fact-checking organization Full Fact that the images these theories are based on aren’t live satellite data. “Although satellite data has been used in the construction of the emission inventories, these emissions do not account for the day-to-day variations in SO2 emissions and as such cannot account for sudden changes in human activity,” Arlindo M. da Silva told the fact-checking organization. False: Scientists have proven that humans got the novel coronavirus from eating bats One prominent theory is that the coronavirus spread through human consumption of bats. BuzzFeed reported that a prominent video about the novel coronavirus in Hindi that’s attracted more than 13 million amplified the claim that eating bats caused the coronavirus outbreak. This theory, which has popped up throughout social media, is also linked to unfounded speculation that the coronavirus was started at the Wuhan Virology Institute.Those claims have helped fuel racism against people of Chinese descent, and Asian people more broadly, throughout the world.", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "It’s true that there has been research into a potential link between bats and the coronavirus, but it’s important to be very cautious in interpreting the findings. First, there is no evidence that eating bats caused the coronavirus outbreak. And Jonathan Epstein, a veterinarian and an epidemiologist EcoHealth Alliance, told Vox earlier this month that it’s “still not known” whether this outbreak started with bats at an animal market.“It’s clear there was some environmental contamination in the market that includes this virus. And that’s what we know so far. So it’s likely that people were infected in that market,” Epstein told Vox. “But I think there is still some question about how the earlier cases may have been exposed.” And here’s what the CDC reports: “Analysis of the genetic tree of this virus indicates it originated in bats, but whether the virus jumped directly from bats or whether there was an intermediary animal host is not, yet, known.” False: Scientists predicted the virus will kill 65 million people In October 2019, a Johns Hopkins research center ran an “exercise” that aimed to model the global response to a potential epidemic. Many people online have misinterpreted the study and erroneously linked its predictions to the possible death toll of an outbreak similar to what we’re currently witnessing with the novel coronavirus. In other words, the Johns Hopkins study had nothing to do with the coronavirus, although the scenario studied might seem similar.", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "This is a popular line of misinformation on Twitter. There are several tweets, including one that’s still up with over 140,000 “likes,” claiming that scientists have predicted that the Wuhan coronavirus will kill 65 million people. That’s not accurate.“ We modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction,” the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said in a statement. “We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people.” False: China built a biological weapon that was leaked from a lab in Wuhan Right now, it’s not clear where this new strain of coronavirus originated. Officials believe it may be linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, but scientists still aren’t exactly sure how or where it developed. On social media, however, there are many other completely unproven theories about its origin that imply the outbreak of the virus may be linked to bioweapons research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a research institute that houses the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory. This Facebook post that’s been shared more than 4,000 times says that it’s “believed that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is where the disease may have originated.”", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "This idea appears to be based, in part, on comments a former Israeli military officer shared with the Washington Times, a right-wing outlet whose past articles have suggested that President Barack Obama might be Muslim and have spread conspiracy theories. Back in January Jim Banks, a Republican congressman from Indiana, even tweeted out a link to the Washington Times article. His tweet has been shared more than 1,000 times. (Rep. Banks did not respond to a request for comment.) And this month, Sen. Tom Cotton also amplified similar speculations. As shocking as the biowarfare lab theory might be, experts have told the Washington Post that there’s no evidence to support it. And the lab itself said in a statement that misinformation had “caused severe damage to our researchers who have been dedicated to working on the front line, and seriously interrupted the emergency research we are doing during the epidemic.” False: Chinese spies smuggled the virus out of Canada Social media posts are pushing the unproven premise that the novel coronavirus found in Wuhan was smuggled from a lab in Canada as part of China’s clandestine quest for a bioweapon, a theory debunked by Politifact. It’s a theory that seems to be somewhat related to the Wuhan lab conspiracy. One tweet by Republican Party official Solomon Yue, who has more than 100,000 followers, said: “#coronavirus is stolen from Canada by espionage & sent to Wuhan to be weaponized to kill foreign enemies.” Although a Chinese researcher working in Canada is under investigation for a possible policy breach after she was invited to the Wuhan lab twice a year for two years, according to Politifact, there’s “no evidence” to support the claim that she “stole coronavirus samples and gave them to the Wuhan lab to create biological weapons.”", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "False: A coronavirus vaccine already exists Another popular theory is that a vaccine for the novel coronavirus already exists, and some are even suggesting that the vaccine was previously patented. While researchers in several countries are working to develop a vaccine, no such vaccine has yet been developed, according to FactCheck.org and Politifact. But this hasn’t stopped people from going online and claiming otherwise. A recent post on Facebook claims that the coronavirus was a “set up” to sell vaccines and includes screenshots claiming to show a patent for a new vaccine. In this particular case, because Facebook’s fact-checkers verified the post as containing false information, a handful of “related articles” show up below the post, pointing users to verified sites that debunk the vaccine conspiracy theory. If you try to share the post, Facebook issues a warning stating that independent fact-checkers have said it contains false information.", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "But even though Facebook has placed warnings on some vaccine hoaxes related to the Wuhan coronavirus, the content isn’t flagged as false on every platform. On Twitter, for example, one tweet that’s gained close to 2,000 “likes” suggests that a vaccine for the coronavirus is owned by the Pirbright Institute, an English infectious disease research institute that focuses on farm animals. This claim is false. The Pirbright Institute issued a statement shared by FactCheck.org, clarifying that its researchers don’t work with human coronaviruses, and that a patent that they hold is unrelated to the current coronavirus linked to Wuhan. Some have also attempted to profit from spreading the false information that’s there’s a cure (there’s none yet), and the Federal Trade Commission warned the public earlier this month that “scammers are taking advantage of fears” about the illness and “setting up websites to sell bogus products, and using fake emails, texts, and social media posts as a ruse to take your money and get your personal information. False: There were 100,000 confirmed cases in January As of March 4, there were nearly 95,000 cases of the coronavirus, but at the very end of January, when that number was less than 10,000, people were vastly inflating the number of infected people beyond what any official source has reported. It’s an important reminder that, when trying to figure out the scale of the virus’s spread, it’s worth looking to reputable, official sources, such as the World Health Organization. The Center for Systems Science and Engineer at Johns Hopkins also maintains a useful map documenting the number of confirmed cases throughout the world. It’s true that on January 26, one public health expert told the Guardian, however, “Almost certainly many tens of thousands of people are infected.” He added, “My best guess now is perhaps 100,000 cases right now.” But that big scary number can be misleading because it was a guess and that number had not been confirmed.", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "Nevertheless, many popular posts on social platforms spread statistics that served to scare people with numbers that do not match the official count. Some of these posts cite medical workers in Wuhan, without evidence. For instance, one YouTube video posted on January 25 shows someone identified as a nurse, who says there were as many as 90,000 people infected with the disease in China alone. Similarly, in late January on Twitter, an account disguised as a news outlet shared an audio clip that claimed that the time, 100,000 people have been infected. It’s worth noting that there’s legitimate doubt about whether the Chinese government is accurately reporting the extent of the virus’ impact. At least eight people have been arrested by the Chinese government for spreading hoaxes, according to reporting from the Poynter Institute in January. On the popular Chinese social media app WeChat, some have said that frontline reports by medical workers are being taken down. Still, the exact number of people infected by the coronavirus remains unknown. False: A teen on TikTok is the first case in Canada On TikTok, some teenagers have pretended to be infected with the virus. One student in Vancouver posted a popular video falsely claiming his friend had the first Canadian confirmed case of coronavirus. The video showed a teenager vomiting in school trash cans and wearing a mask around campus. In an interview with the Daily Beast, a spokesperson for the British Columbia Department of Health confirmed that the video is fake. At the time, the only confirmed case of coronavirus in British Columbia, at the time of the video was posted, was a man in his 40s. TikTok appears to have deleted the original viral video which had over 4.1 million views, but a similar video, posted by the same user, showed a teen alleging a classmate had contracted the virus remained up as of February 20. That morning, the company said it released a feature directing users to trusted sources of information, like the WHO, when they search for coronavirus-related content in the app. False: The Chinese government built a hospital overnight It’s worth noting that the Chinese state media has also been spreading false information. As BuzzFeed News first pointed out, two state media outlets — Global Times and People’s Daily — circulated an image of a newly constructed building and claimed it was a hospital in Wuhan that was constructed in just 16 hours. In fact, the building in the image was an apartment building more than 600 miles away.", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "This is just one example of how the Chinese government and state-backed organizations have used false or misleading information to portray the outbreak as being under control. How tech platforms are responding Every social media company Recode reached said they were working to reduce the impact of false information about the coronavirus in some way, to varying extents. In addition to taking down conspiracy theories and provided WHO free advertising, Facebook said it’s also working on “blocking people from running ads that try to exploit the situation.” Zuckerberg said, as an example, that would include a company promoting a product that claimed to cure a disease. He also said,: “Researchers are already using aggregated and anonymized Facebook data — including mobility data and population density maps — to better understand how the virus is spreading. In a statement, Twitter appeared to echo some of the latest steps being taken by Facebook. The company said it would “halt any attempt by advertisers to opportunistically use the Covid-19 outbreak to target inappropriate ads,” that it was working with fact checkers to promote accurate content on the site, and that it was also supplying data to researchers. Twitter also said it’s not “seeing significant coordinated platform manipulation efforts around these issues.” This doesn’t mean that there’s not false information about coronavirus on Twitter, as the hoaxes we mentioned earlier prove. Twitter’s response simply indicates that the company hasn’t found any evidence of intentional disinformation campaigns by someone, like a state actor or political group. In the early days of the outbreak, Facebook’s approach was to put fact-checking alerts on false content related to conspiracy theories. But at the end of January, the company announced that it would take additional action: We will also start to remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them. We are doing this as an extension of our existing policies to remove content that could cause physical harm. We’re focusing on claims that are designed to discourage treatment or taking appropriate precautions. This includes claims related to false cures or prevention methods — like drinking bleach cures the coronavirus — or claims that create confusion about health resources that are available. We will also block or restrict hashtags used to spread misinformation on Instagram, and are conducting proactive sweeps to find and remove as much of this content as we can. Twitter has also placed a warning label linking to the CDC when users search “coronavirus.”", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "Meanwhile, starting in late January, TikTok began issuing a notification for users when they search for the “coronavirus” hashtag in the app. The alert encourages users to look to “trusted sources” like the WHO for accurate information and to report content that might violate its community guidelines. TikTok told Recode in a statement that its guidelines “do not permit misinformation that could cause harm to our community or the larger public,” adding that “[w]hile we encourage our users to have respectful conversations about the subjects that matter to them, we remove deliberate attempts to misrepresent authoritative sources of news.” YouTube has its own version of an advisory. Beginning in late January, the video platform began showing short previews of text-based news articles about the coronavirus in search results. If you search “coronavirus” on YouTube, for example, you’re linked to a WHO landing page about the novel coronavirus. YouTube told Recode that false information generally does not violate the platform’s rules unless it involves hate speech, harassment, scams, or inciting violence. The company also said it aims to reduce the recommendations of what it deems “borderline content” or videos that could misinform users in harmful ways — including false information about coronavirus. Despite these efforts, it’s seemingly impossible for these platforms to take down every false coronavirus post as soon as one pops up. As with any kind of misinformation, it’s a game of never-ending whack-a-mole. But the continued prevalence of false info about the outbreak, one month into its existence, shows how essential it is to contain the spread of misinformation, especially with serious health consequences involved. Update March 4: This post has updated throughout with more examples of hoaxes as well as new information on the outbreak and tech company responses.", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "Be careful where you get your news about coronavirus", "valid": 0},
    {"text": "News about the new and deadly virus that appeared in Wuhan, China in December of 2019 is everywhere. The virus is now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes is called COVID-19. Where should you turn for the latest information on a rapidly changing situation? It’s hard to beat the convenience of the internet, and we know there’s a lot of useful and reliable information online. But there’s also a lot of misinformation. The trick is to figure out which is which. Why you need to know about this new virus The concern regarding this rapidly spreading virus is well-deserved. At this writing, statistics on infections and deaths worldwide are truly sobering. Unfortunately, the numbers are likely to rise as efforts to quickly contain its spread have proven unsuccessful. So, it’s particularly important to get reliable information about what is happening and to find out what you can do to protect yourself. Beware: Misinformation is rampant Just as the number of people and countries affected by this new virus have spread, so have conspiracy theories and unfounded claims about it. Social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok, have seen a number of false and misleading posts, such as: “Oregano Oil Proves Effective Against Coronavirus,” an unfounded claim a hoax stating that the US government had created and patented a vaccine for coronavirus years ago, shared with nearly 5,000 Facebook users a false claim that “coronavirus is a human-made virus in the laboratory” sales of unproven “nonmedical immune boosters” to help people ward off 2019-nCoV unfounded recommendations to prevent infection by taking vitamin C and avoiding spicy foods dangerous suggestions that drinking bleach and snorting cocaine can cure coronavirus infection a video with useless advice about preventing infection with the new coronavirus by modifying your diet (for example, by avoiding cold drinks, milkshakes, or ice cream). This video, which demonstrates the removal of a parasitic worm from a person’s lip, is many years old and has nothing to do with the current virus. Facebook is trying to fact-check postings, label those that are clearly false, and reduce their ranking so they are less prominently displayed. Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok have also taken steps to limit or label misinformation. But it’s nearly impossible to catch them all, especially since some are in private social media groups and are harder to find. Don’t forget about the flu While news of a novel and deadly virus spreading across the globe may be terrifying, it’s important to recognize that there’s another, more familiar virus in this country to be concerned about:  it’s the flu. According to the CDC, there have already been up to 51 million cases of the flu this season, leading to hundreds of thousands of hospital admissions and up to 55,000 deaths. Getting a flu shot is a great first step if you’re worrying about avoiding illness. Other measures to protect yourself from the flu (such as staying away from others who are sick and taking care to not infect others if you’re sick) are basic strategies that can also help you avoid the new coronavirus. Reliable online sources on the new coronavirus and COVID-19 While no one source of information is perfect, some are undeniably better than others! It’s best to look for sites that: rely on experts who use well-accepted scientific analyses and publish their results in reputable medical journals have a mission to inform and protect the public, such as the CDC and the WHO, which recently added a myth busters page to its information on the virus are not promoting or selling a product related to the information provided. Other good online sources of information on the virus include: Medline Plus, from the US National Library of Medicine the UK’s National Health Service the US Food and Drug Administration major news outlets with deep expertise in health reporting, such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Boston Globe’s STAT News. While gathering information online may be your easiest initial option, isolate yourself and contact your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection, such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath. (If you don’t have a doctor, call the nearest clinic for advice.) If necessary, a doctor may recommend that you see a specialist at an academic medical center (such as a hospital affiliated with a major medical school) who is likely to have the most recent information about a previously unknown infectious illness like this one. The bottom line When considering a new infectious disease about which so much is still unknown, it’s important to seek out reliable information and act on it. Be skeptical of implausible conspiracy theories or claims of “fake news” that dismiss recommendations from public health officials. Addressing the concerns surrounding the new coronavirus requires accessible, reliable, and frequently updated information; the best we can do is to look to the experts whose mission it is to protect public health.

    {"text": "The WHO's handling of the epidemic has come under criticism amidst what has been described as the agency's 'diplomatic balancing act' between 'China and China's critics,' including scrutiny of the relationship between the agency and Chinese authorities.[173] Initial concerns included the observation that while WHO relies upon data provided and filtered by member states, China has had a 'historical aversion to transparency and sensitivity to international criticism'.[174] While the WHO and some world leaders have praised the Chinese government's transparency in comparison to the 2003 SARS outbreak,[175] others including John Mackenzie of the WHO's emergency committee and Anne Schuchat of the US' CDC have shown skepticism, suggesting that China's official tally of cases and deaths may be an underestimation. Other experts, including David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, have said in response to skepticism on transparency that 'China has been very transparent and open in sharing its data … they’re sharing it very well and they opened up all of their files with the WHO present.' In response to the criticisms, Director-General Tedros has stated that China 'doesn't need to be asked to be praised. China has done many good things to slow down the virus. The whole world can judge. There is no spinning here,'[176] and further stating that 'I know there is a lot of pressure on WHO when we appreciate what China is doing but because of pressure we should not fail to tell the truth, we don't say anything to appease anyone. It's because it's the truth.'[177] Some observers have accused the WHO of being unable to risk antagonizing the Chinese government, as otherwise the agency would not have been able stay informed on the domestic state of the outbreak and influence response measures there, after which there would have 'likely have been a raft of articles criticizing the WHO for needlessly offending China at a time of crisis and hamstringing its own ability to operate.'[177] Through this, experts such as Dr. David Nabarro have defended this strategy in order 'to ensure Beijing's co-operation in mounting an effective global response to the outbreak'.[178] Osman Dar, director of the One Health Project at the Chatham House Centre on Global Health Security defended the WHO's conduct, stating that the same pressure was one 'that UN organisations have always had from the advanced economies.'[173] The inclusion of the 'Taiwan region' in the WHO's daily situation reports, which resulted in Taiwan receiving the same WHO 'very high' risk rating as the mainland despite only a having a relatively small number of cases on the ROC-governed island has led to protests by Taiwan who says that the rating has led to it receiving travel bans as a result.[179][180] Further concerns regarding Taiwan's non-member status in the WHO has been on the effect this has on increasing Taiwan's vulnerability in the case of an outbreak in the country without proper channels to the WHO. In response, the WHO has said that they 'have Taiwanese experts involved in all of our consultations ... so they're fully engaged and fully aware of all of the developments in the expert networks.'[181] WHO and traditional medicine WHO has been moving toward acceptance and integration of traditional medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. In 2022, the new International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-11, will attempt to enable classifications from traditional medicine to be integrated with classifications from evidence-based medicine. This and other support of WHO for such practices has been criticized by the science-based medicine community as it has generally criticized the use of alternative medicine.[182]", "valid": 0},

The bats carrying CoV ZC45 were originally found in Yunnan or Zhejiang province, both of which were more than 900 kilometers away from the seafood market. Bats were normally found to live in caves and trees. But the seafood market is in a densely-populated district of Wuhan, a metropolitan of ~15 million people. The probability was very low for the bats to fly to the market. According to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors, the bat was never a food source in the city, and no bat was traded in the market.

    {"text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Coronavirus Syndrome is not just a simple coronavirus named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization.  It’s actually a far more complex pathogenic micro-organism and disease process than the medical authorities are aware of.  More significantly, it is the biological etiology and environmental causation that must be correctly understood if Coronavirus Syndrome is to be successfully treated. There are 3 primary elements of COVID-5G-Hypertoxicity Syndrome as stated in the new disease name. First, there is the pathogenic micro-organism, that was intentionally weaponized in a U.S. military laboratory as a specific gene pool-targeted bioweapon called COVID-19, which was bioengineered to mutate to elude proper diagnosis as well as morph symptomatically to evade effective treatment. Secondly, there is the overwhelming impact of 5G, 4G, 3G and other electromagnetic frequency signal ranges and microwave transmissions on vulnerable individuals with respect to triggering COVID-19, as well as sustaining and/or intensifying the disease process. Thirdly, there is a global chemical geoengineering regime that sprays Chemtrails, as well as a Super-Vaccination Agenda, which contribute considerably to the state of Hypertoxicity of each individual who contracts COVID-19, the severity of which is determined by their toxic load or total body burden. There are several other risk factors such as medical history, overall health status, medical ailments, health conditions, age, diet, etc. involved in the development of Coronavirus Syndrome.  However, each of those potentially weighty risk factors is patient-specific and will not be addressed in this summary with the exception of the underlying health conditions and prevailing medical ailments. Italian Authorities: 99% of Coronavirus Fatalities Had Other Illnesses and Underlying Conditions After the top 3 causes, the most significant risk factors concern the prevailing medical ailments and complicating health conditions of a COVID-19 patient.  All the evidence has born out that those coronavirus patients with certain illnesses and conditions, prior to contracting COVID-19, had a much higher infection rate and mortality rate.", "valid": 2},
    {"text": "5G & IoT The three greatest clusters of Coronavirus Syndrome on each continent were located in 3 major cities which had already experienced what was essentially a military deployment of a 5G power grid.  As follows: “This is also why three of the most serious coronavirus outbreaks on 3 continents — Asia, Europe and North America — took place in major metro areas that had undergone advanced 5G roll-outs—Wuhan, China; Milan, Italy; and Seattle, Washington, respectively.  Each of these three “5G demonstration zones” have produced the highest COVID-19 infection rates and mortality rates in the world today.” (Source: The Most Fatal Coronavirus Outbreaks and Intensive 5G Roll-outs Conclusively Correlate) Update: The greater New York City area is now experiencing several coronavirus clusters, as expected, because of the particularly intensive 5G roll-out there throughout 2019.  The United States now exceeds China for new COVID-19 cases and is on track to see more deaths as well (American cities with 5G will contribute substantially to that increasing mortality rate).  The rapidly expanding NYC 5G power grid represents the fourth major metropolitan area in the world where 5G zones exploded into massive coronavirus infection sites practically overnight. There is undoubtedly a direct correlation between the intensive deployment of 5G and the incidence of Coronavirus Syndrome.  All the science has proven that the exceedingly powerful and harmful energies associated with a fully operational 5G system significantly weaken the human immune system.  Therefore, people living in “5G Demonstration Zones” will inevitably be much more vulnerable to all the seasonal influenzas, and especially to the highly opportunistic and virulent COVID-19.", "valid": 2},
    {"text": "Some medical researchers have declared that 5G actually triggers COVID-19, which then sets into motion a unique disease process that manifests differently in each patient.  Because there appears to be a bioengineered capacity for COVID-19 to mutate in vivo, the symptom set can change quickly or slowly thereby eluding proper diagnosis and effective treatment.  The longer any patient is exposed to a 5G environment, the more severe the symptoms will be.  Similarly, additional symptoms, some of which are quite unusual and life-threatening, will also emerge as the disease process evolves. Not only does 5G seem to trigger the onset of the Coronavirus Syndrome, it also appears to cause an extraordinary mutation and morphing of COVID-19 into an altogether different coronavirus pathogen, which then lies latent in the body well after the patient has been cured.  This is quite similar to Epstein-Barr virus which eventually evolves into EBV-Stage 4 after passing through Stages 1, 2 and 3 over decades of latency. The extent to which a patient is exposed to the Internet of Things (IoT) poses an even greater challenge to their immune system.  This is why so many cruise ships became floating hospitals so soon after the Wuhan outbreak (there was simply not enough time for Wuhan patients or carriers to board the affected ships).  Not only was 5G fully operational on those quarantined ships, the cruise lines promoted their seaborne IoTs to all the younger passengers while the many of the older passengers suffered from immunosuppression or compromised health.  As expected, the older folks suffered a much higher COVID-19 infection rate   Then, when the first COVID-19 case was reported, the protracted period of quarantine on the cruise ships served to spread the coronavirus even more in the close quarters. Undoubtedly, it’s the high re-infection rates of COVID-19 which illustrate the dramatic effects that a 5G environment has on either a carrier or patient.  Those who leave the hospital as a cured COVID-19 patient and re-enter their same wireless IT space will invariably suffer a higher rate of re-infection.  Some will eventually suffer double or triple re-infections in the same flu season.", "valid": 2},
    {"text": "Incidentally, the Coronavirus Syndrome is emphatically not caused by a typical flu bug. COVID-19 is a highly sophisticated bioweapon that was deliberately bioengineered to be extremely opportunistic, predatory and pernicious.

But the most important move anyone can make is to strictly avoid all 5G super-hotspots and IoT spaces such as cruise ships. Despite the apparent contagion, the right lifestyle and diet will keep COVID-19 at bay for most people.  This type of coronavirus preys on a weak and/or sick individual whose internal environment is conducive to viral propagation and symptom proliferation.  In any event, preventative measures ought to be taken immediately by those at greatest risk.  And, it’s absolutely necessary to aggressively treat all symptoms, especially those that are overly incapacitating or vitiate normal bodily functions.

    {"text": "Chemtrails There are other major pieces to this Coronavirus Syndrome puzzle that remain outside of any individual’s ability to control.  For example, there are toxic chemtrail aerosols that are being sprayed incessantly in our skies.  The immense volume of chemically-mobile aluminum alone is slowly poisoning all of humanity.  So is the barium, strontium, lithium and other chemical contaminants that are released into the troposphere via the chemical geoengineering programs being conducted worldwide. See: CHEMTRAILS: A Planetary Catastrophe Created by Chemical Geoengineering There has been a substantial intensification of chemtrail spraying operations over the past decade.  The incidence of both Chemtrail syndrome and Chemtrail flu have seen an appreciable and alarming increase.  The radical uptick in neurological diseases such as Autism spectrum disorder, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Myotrophic lateral sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis, Cerebral palsy, Muscular dystrophy, Epilepsy, Guillain-Barré syndrome and Bell’s palsy is proof that there are major environmental factors such as the unprecedented profusion of airborne aluminum which is a proven neurotoxin. CHEMTRAIL SYNDROME: A Global Pandemic Of Epic Proportions There’s only one way that the atmosphere could have become so permeated with so much chemically-mobile aluminum so rapidly: the nonstop chemtrail spraying of toxic aerosols worldwide.  The real problem here is that the blood-brain barrier surrounding the olfactory nerve is not 8 cells thick; it’s only 4 to 6 cells wide which means that a LOT of aluminum is now going into the brain.  Of course, bio-accumulation of aluminum is also taking place elsewhere in the human body where it will cause other serious diseases as well. Before the Industrial Revolution, there was very little atmospheric aluminum.  This toxic heavy metal had been safely locked up in the Earth’s surface (in bauxite) where it could do very little harm to the human bio-organism.  With the advent of the coal-fired power plant industry, massive volumes of coal fly ash — a highly regulated waste product — was produced which contains a large percentage of aluminum oxide.  So, what the chemical geoengineers decided to do was to put this hazardous waste product — COAL FLY ASH — into the chemtrail formulations because of its hygroscopic nature. See: U.S. Government Spraying Tons Of Toxic Coal Fly Ash Into Atmosphere Via Chemtrails KEY POINT: Some atmospheric heavy metals such as chemically mobile aluminum are highly hygroscopic causing the chemtrails to widen quickly after spraying, which will then develop into chemclouds before forming a sun-obscuring chemcloud cover.  In this furtive manner, humanity is being regularly deprived of the natural vitamin D production that takes place when sunlight shines on the skin.  Also, pathogenic micro-organisms such as the coronavirus will more swiftly proliferate in the absence of sunlight.  After all, “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.” The essential point here is that everyone now lives under heavily chemtrailed skies and, therefore, is exposed daily to high doses of unwanted aluminum.  The steady incorporation of aluminum into our tissues and organs has created a public health disaster of epic proportions.  However, it’s the pivotal part that aluminum and other chemtrail contaminants play in the development of Coronavirus Syndrome that is of greatest concern today.  Because of the neurological impairment that occurs at the cellular level with the onset of Coronavirus Syndrome, it can be stated that the ongoing chemtrail operations purposefully set the stage for this stealthily manufactured pandemic*. *Really, we want to know why the CDC posted job notices across the USA for a Quarantine Program Public Health Advisor on 11/15/2019—2 months before the Wuhan outbreak?! It has also been suspected that Chemtrail-disseminated ingredients are an integral part of the geoengineering scheme to fabricate tropospheric conditions that are much more favorable to running an efficient 5G paradigm.  Those heavy metals and other chemical compounds were specifically chosen because they are good conductors for the necessary frequencies and energies that constitute a fully functional 5G power grid. Each of the major COVID-19 clusters to date have occurred in heavily chemtrailed cities, including the most recent clusters in the greater New York City area. It should also be noted that there are certain components in chemtrail aerosols that were selected because of their capacity to either trigger or encourage the development of the various influenzas.  Every flu season sees a considerable escalation of chemtrailing, particularly in urban areas, in order to stampede the residents into the pen of vaccine compliance.  A bad flu will compel an unaware sufferer to receive a vaccination thereby increasing their toxic load.", "valid": 2},
    {"text": "COVID-19 While COVID-19 is the primary pathogenic micro-organism of Coronavirus Syndrome, it’s imperative to understand that it’s only one component of COVID-5G-Hypertoxicity Syndrome.  It’s also quite important to comprehend that COVID-19 is just one of the many coronaviruses some of which are the cause of the common cold and other influenzas (See addendum below).  But the real secret behind this weaponized virus can be found in its name. CORONAVIRUS BIOWEAPON MYSTERY SOLVED: It’s all in the name! As the “CORONAvirus” name implies, once the crucial link is made between the coronavirus and 5G, it becomes clear that the whole human race is about to suffer a biblical scourge because of the countless 5G rolls-out presently taking place around the globe.  Any advanced bioweapon that has undergone so many decades of exceedingly sophisticated bioengineering and is now turbo-charged via the 5G energy weapon system is bound to have awesome effect. 5G WEAPONRY: Microwave Radiation Technology Being Deployed as Depopulation Warfare, Full Spectrum Dominance & Total Human Control (Video) Not only that, many folks have been suffering terribly from various types of EMF illness and EMR disease and Microwave poisoning and Non-ionizing Radiation sickness and Electrohypersensitivity syndrome for many decades…totally oblivious to the real causes.  Therefore, it could even be stated that, were there no electrical paradigm on planet Earth today, there would be no Coronavirus Syndrome in 2020. Nevertheless, to properly understand the “who, what, where, why and how” narrative regarding the now notorious coronavirus, every reader is encouraged to consider the links in this extensive compilation of detailed exposés about COVID-19: BIOENGINEERED and 5Ged CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: What Everyone Needs to Know KEY POINTS: It must be made clear that, to date, there has been no conclusive scientific evidence that proves the existence of COVID-19.  Similarly, there has been no assurance whatsoever given by medical authorities or government officials, that a reliable diagnostic test is being administered to patients that have somehow tested positive for COVID-19.  As always, governments everywhere have withheld the most basic information and essential data regarding this supposedly burgeoning pandemic.  That does not mean there’s not a very real bioweapon at the root of this ongoing bioterrorism and global psyop; however, they clearly do not want the people to know what it really is.  But the “real bioweapon” may just be the 5G weapon system. See: 5G WEAPONRY: Microwave Radiation Technology Being Deployed as Depopulation Warfare, Full Spectrum Dominance & Total Human Control (Video) Special Note: Many folks are having a problem reconciling how the COVID-19 panic is a HUGE hoax, yet at the very same time a very real pandemic.  Even though there is no scientific proof of COVID-19 or high-integrity lab tests to confirm infection, there is a new and deadly and virulent pathogenic micro-organism that was meticulously bioengineered to cause COVID-5G-Hypertoxicity Syndrome.  In other words, this is not just a single viral bioweapon, it a complex bioweapon system that has been surreptitiously put into place over several decades.  So, while the various GLADIO black ops and New World Order psyops may appear to working at cross purposes, or even mutually exclusive, they are not.  This particular false flag operation and mass casualty event was concocted to be exceptionally confusing, just as the accompanying psychological operation was contrived to be awfully confounding.

    {"text": "Hypertoxicity There is a modern-day malady that is not well known called Hypertoxicity Syndrome.  It’s caused by the extraordinary and continuous bio-accumulation of every kind of toxin that humanity is now exposed to.  It is also the gateway disease for many other types of much more debilitating and deadly diseases such as Morgellons disease. Clearly, those who suffer from Hypertoxicity Syndrome will be much more susceptible to the Coronavirus Syndrome than those with a clean, non-toxic health profile.  There are many and diverse contributing factors to that extraordinary state of hypertoxicity that very few are aware of.  For obvious reasons, the elderly will always suffer from this condition much more than children, which is exactly why older patients are dying so quickly from COVID-19, and in much greater numbers. Young people are simply far less toxic because they have had fewer years of environmental exposures.  The extremely high toxic load of the elderly is due to the fact that they have experienced several more decades of bio-accumulation of countless chemicals, heavy metals, insecticides, toxicants, poisons, contaminants, pollutants, etc.  Hence, there is a direct relationship between the total body burden and the susceptibility to COVID-19, just as there is to any other acute illness or chronic disease.  Except that a hypertoxic internal disorder will encourage Coronavirus Syndrome to run rampant just as we have seen because of how opportunistic it was bioengineered to be. Industrial pollution also provides many vectors of toxin dissemination, which has always contributed majorly to the ongoing worldwide epidemic of Hypertoxicity Syndrome.  Just like Beijing, Wuhan is also infamous for its oppressive and unceasing pollution.

    {"text": "Super-Vaccination Agenda The preceding graphic says it all where it concerns the accelerated vaccine being produced in Israel.  Because annual flu shots are already highly suspect in the causation of increasingly worse flu seasons, the special vaccine being formulated for COVID-19 will, in all likelihood, serve as a major trigger for the full-blown coronavirus disease process.  There are other critical aspects to a coronavirus vaccine that are beyond the scope of this exposé such as remote-controlled nano-sized components which work in tandem with 5G 60 GHz millimeter waves.  Irrespective of the multiple dangers and obvious risks associated with the Super-Vaccination Agenda, who would ever trust a vaccine manufactured in Tel Aviv?! Perhaps the single greatest and most dangerous threat where it concerns hypertoxicity are the ever-expanding childhood vaccination schedules and annual flu vaccine programs.  Particularly for the elderly, the yearly flu shot injects a panoply of biological and chemical toxins that are exceedingly harmful to their fragile and compromised bodies.  This is exactly why so many older folks have disproportionately died from COVID-19.  Their total body burden, after years of highly toxic flu vaccinations, is so high that the coronavirus disease simply overwhelms the entire bio-organism. Most significantly, there are now strong indications that each successive flu vaccination will make any individual, no matter what their unique set of risk factors, MUCH more vulnerable to a COVID-19 infection.  Some have even speculated that a variant of COVID-19 has been inserted into every flu vaccine.  This is why 2019 saw so many state legislatures approve or attempt to pass so many draconian measures toward making all prescribed childhood vaccinations mandatory and without exemptions.  These repugnant and treacherous legislative initiatives were obviously taken in preparation for the bioengineered coronavirus outbreaks in the United States especially. The Super-Vaccination Agenda is a major piece of the overall plan to, first, toxify and sicken, then, control and enslave humanity.  The highly detrimental vaccine programs being administered worldwide are quite possibly the main driver of Coronavirus Syndrome.  Given the many adverse effects of vaccines, to include weakening of the immune system and triggering of various influenzas due to injection of viruses, the Super-Vaccination Agenda is certainly one of the main pillars of the scheme to bioengineer a full-blown coronavirus pandemic.  A  scientific research study, not funded by Big Pharma, on the direct correlation between COVID-19 outbreaks and local flu vaccination compliance will certainly reveal the truth of the matter.", "valid": 2},
    {"text": "Psychogenic Disease It’s entirely true that there are many diseases and illnesses that plague humanity which are psychogenic to varying degrees. Psychogenic disease (or psychogenic illness) is a name given to physical illnesses that are believed to arise from emotional or mental stressors, or from psychological or psychiatric disorders.[2] There is no better representative of a psychogenic disease than Coronavirus Syndrome.  This Third Millennium plague is surely the ultimate example of how mainstream media-generated hype can literally create a fake pandemic followed by more network hyperventilation necessary to manufacture a panic. There are many prongs to the multi-pronged pandemic/panic strategy that were implemented by the hidden directors, producers and screenwriters of Operation COVID Pandemic & Panic.  Most of them are well beyond the scope of this exposé.  However, there is one prong of this global psychological operation that cannot be ignored. Fear of death and fear of terminal disease are probably two of the greatest fears experienced by most people.  The perpetrators of Operation COVID Pandemic & Panic know this full well and have intentionally played on those primordial fears like never before.  The ensuing collective stress — emotional, mental, psychological and spiritual — that has been artificially induced is unparalleled in post-modern history. KEY POINT: Every staged panic has a Fearmonger-in-Chief.  Today, that carefully chosen individual is the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases—Anthony Stephen Fauci. (See: FAUCI the FEARMONGER Goes to Work for the Globalists).  The MO of every Fearmonger-in-Chief is to use utterly fake science, misleading data and false narratives to scare their audience as follows: Dr. Fauci is promoting totally fake science (Video). Any psyop of this breadth and depth will only serve to amplify the negative vibrations that are being engendered worldwide both individually and collectively.  Whole nations have been plunged into despair.  Cities have been devastated. Large companies have been shut down as major corporations have suspended all operations.  Small businesses have already been bankrupted as families have been paralyzed with fear and anxiety about the future.", "valid": 2},
    {"text": "THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE Therefore, it’s now apparent that there is a HUGE experiment being undertaken to propagate the Coronavirus Syndrome as a fundamentally psychogenic disease in advance of it actually showing up wherever the perps have planned acts of bioterrorism.  There are several reasons for this New World Order ploy to effectively imprison humanity, most of which are explained in this exposé: MEDICAL MARTIAL LAW: Is this how they plan to lock down planet Earth?. Because every psychogenic disease relies on a critical mass of people buying into the CON, the best way to terminate this utterly staged panic is to share the truth.  The most radioactive truths and incriminating facts always concern the WHO and WHY.  As follows: Nothing changes until those who secretly rule US are prosecuted for 9/11, JFK, OK City, 5G, Chemtrails, Vaccines, COVID-19 …. Perhaps the most powerful piece of this fastidiously choreographed and orchestrated psyop is the inexorable push toward social distancing.  Not only does this ploy separate each and every human being from the rest of the human race, it is a subtle form of “divide and conquer”.  Everyone is now looked at as coronavirus-carrier and therefore to be avoided.  Moreover, this type of abiding fear of both coronavirus and humanity breeds more fear and anxiety which will only further weaken the immune system. Bioterrorism What we are all witnessing is an ongoing series of bioterrorist attacks against nations large and small.  Genocide, depopulation and threats of an ELE are all being methodically carried out by the New World Order globalist cabal.  Hard-to-prove and extremely efficacious bioterrorism, in particular, is perhaps the easiest way for the globalists to kill so may birds with one stone. While each of those naked crimes against humanity constitute mass murder, the ultimate NWO goals are many and diverse.  In fact, the globalists have several reasons for perpetrating this crime wave of bioterrorism currently washing over the planet; hence, it ought to be quite obvious even to the uninitiated. See: OPERATION CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: 16 Reasons for the Deployment of this Devastating Bioweapon in 2020 As for who’s conducting this international crime spree operationally, it’s now clear that COVID-19 originated at the US Military’s bio-weapons lab at Fort Detrick (which was shut down by the CDC in July, because of outbreaks).  However, just because COVID-19 was bioengineered by the U.S. Military doesn’t mean this was an American-only black operation and C.I.A. psyop.  In point of fact, China’s 9/11 in Wuhan was actually carried out by OPERATION GLADIO under the rubric of NATO (sometimes known as the “North Atlantic Terrorist Organization”).", "valid": 2},
    {"text": "What’s the salient point? When anyone or nation is under withering attack, it’s imperative to react accordingly.  However, very few are cognizant of the biowarfare that has been waged against humanity since the Spanish Flu of 1918. “As a matter of historical fact, there have been numerous bioweapons released against certain nations and populations over the past century such as Asian Flu of 1957, Hong Kong Flu of 1968, Epstein-Barr virus, Human papillomavirus, Herpes simplex virus, Lyme disease, AIDS/HIV, Swine flu, Bird flu, Ebola virus disease, West Nile virus, as well as many of the Measles and Smallpox outbreaks. (Remember the Native American tribes that were deliberately wiped out via the Smallpox bioweapon during the 19th century.)” (Source: PLANDEMIC! A Painstakingly Planned Pandemic and Staged Panic—Who & Why?) Hence, the time has finally come for people everywhere to come together to terminate -FOREVER – this never-ending Biowar, the perilous 5G roll-out and the climate-changing Chemtrails. Conclusion COVID-5G-Hypertoxicity Syndrome is precisely what the name says it is. The intensity of its manifestation is also a function of several other risk factors, each of which can be nailed down in any particular case by an experienced clinician and/or skilled diagnostician. And, “YES!”, Coronavirus Syndrome is most definitely an ever-changing syndrome that can defy diagnosis and treatment alike.  This’s why so many were dropping like flies before they dropped dead in Wuhan and Milan.  The symptoms either intensify so fast, or unusual symptoms emerge so quickly, that the attending physicians are caught flat-footed.  The patients, themselves, are then overwhelmed by the severity and intractability of the symptoms.  In many cases, the combination of debilitating and often unfamiliar symptoms simply demoralizes them. In light of these stark realities, the more aware that each person is about the key takeaways in this critical Coronavirus Syndrome analysis, the more effective their response can be.  The health and well-being of our families and friends, co-workers and other acquaintances greatly depend on this vital knowledge.  Truly, we are at defining moment of human history, and everyone is called upon to play their vital role.  Those who have been blessed with the truth need to share it more than ever. There is another enlightening and edifying perspective on this transparently staged pandemic/panic that’s well worth considering.

How do we know this to be a scientific fact and indisputable truth? Because the U.S. Federal Government has been in possession of hard scientific research studies that conclusively proved numerous medical ailments and health conditions caused by exposure to microwave and radio-frequency radiation. This is precisely why the government has repeatedly refused to conduct the statutorily mandated health and safety studies on 5G—the Fifth Generation Cellular Network Technology.  The authorities already know how hazardous and harmful 5G is, which is why an Historic Class Action Was Lawsuit Filed Against the FCC by Municipalities Across the USA. NMRI Research Report What follows is an official research report published by the Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) 0n April 20, 1972 that clearly documents the “Health Hazards” and “Electromagnetic Radiation Injury” caused by “Microwave and Radio-frequency Radiation”. Now the American people will know why the nationwide 5G roll-out is as dangerous as it is illegal.  The government has no right to harm or kill, injure or main, sicken or afflict, paralyze or incapacitate the citizenry. Governmental conduct that produces these extreme consequences to the populace profoundly violates the public trust between the governed and the government.  Furthermore, such malfeasance and misconduct irrevocably break the social contract between We the People and the U.S. Federal Government.  The sacred covenant between the U.S citizenry and its government has, essentially, been rent asunder. One can only imagine that the 2000 plus scientific research references which were utilized to form the basis of this report in 1972 have since grown to 20,000 or even 200,000 in 2019, 47 years later. Perhaps this is why the Government-Corporate Complex has foisted the 5G roll-out on the country without any of the required research; they already possess the irrefutable and quite damning evidence.

Because Kirkland, Washington is one of the most 5G-intensive locales in the nation—that’s why! SOTN Editor’s Note: That cluster of nursing home deaths reflects the fact that the elderly have far less tolerance to the overly powerful 5G EMF signal ranges and downright dangerous microwave transmissions. One of SOTN’s contributors is the Coronavirus Coach (also 30 years as a Holistic Health Coach) and his first coronavirus client lives in Kirkland, Washington just down the road from America’s coronavirus ground zero—The Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington.  For weeks back in December of 2019 they worked together trying to figure out what the client’s diagnosis was, not only because the unknown-at-that-time coronavirus was so elusive and mysterious, the symptom set seemed to change as it morphed into more serious manifestations of the COVID-19 disease process. It soon became clear that what the patient had been dealing was unlike anything they both had ever seen before, and the client was a health coach as well.  The coronavirus sufferer’s condition inexplicably went from bad to worse so quickly, and to the point where the Coronavirus Coach wondered if they would live through the night on those days when the worst symptoms were really raging.  Had the client not been able to self-doctor so competently and efficiently, they would not have made it. However, at the end of the day, it was the advanced 5G power grid in the town of Kirkland, Washington, as well as the client’s smartphone addiction, workplace WiFi and wireless home environment, that were at the very core of their coronavirus problem.  This exceedingly important data point was already conveyed to other annual influenza patients and flu clients who suffer from smartphone dependency.  The Coronavirus Coach has also published explicit guidance to every COVID-19 patient expressing the dire need to turn off the smartphone and change over to all wired IT connections both at home and work. What happened next to the first coronavirus client is this predictable development: The believe thay are experiencing a re-infection with the coronavirus, which is a unique and distinguishing feature of COVID-19.  Not only are re-infections being clinically observed, but double re-infections are also occurring in some cases.  With a sufficient elapse of time, there will certainly be triple and quadruple re-infections, especially in those cities and communities that have undergone the most intensive 5G roll-outs. This is also why three of the most serious coronavirus outbreaks on 3 continents — Asia, Europe and North America — took place in major metro areas that had undergone advanced 5G roll-outs—Wuhan, China; Milan, Italy; and Seattle Washington, respectively.  Each of these three “5G demonstration zones” have produced the highest COVID-19 infection rates and mortality rates in the world today.", "valid": 2},

The Act requires the President to develop and implement a strategy for the adoption of secure wireless communications technology in the United States and abroad.  The strategy will protect the American people from security threats to telecommunications networks and 5G technology. As part of the strategy, section 4 of the Act purports to require the President to engage in international diplomacy in order to share information and pursue policy goals specified by the Congress.  Consistent with longstanding constitutional practice, my Administration will treat the relevant provisions of this section in a manner that does not interfere with the President’s exclusive constitutional authorities with respect to foreign relations, including the President’s role as the sole representative of the Nation in foreign affairs. Section 5 of the Act further purports to condition the President’s authority to implement parts of the strategy upon the approval of the Federal Communications Commission.  My understanding is that this provision does not preclude me or future Presidents from exercising our constitutional authorities as the “sole organ” of the Nation in foreign relations and as the head of the unitary Executive Branch to ensure proper implementation of the entire strategy. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, March 23, 2020. OMG and Holy Crap!  Warnings about 5G have come from a variety of credible sources including Department of Defense Secretary, Mark Esper. From Newsmax, November 22, 2019: Defense Secretary Mark Esper has asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deny a Virginia wireless company’s license to provide 5G mobile broadband service out of “national security, civil service, and the economic benefit of the nation” concerns. “There are too many unknowns and the risks are far too great to federal operations to allow Ligado’s proposed system to proceed,” Esper said in a letter Monday to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, Bloomberg News reports. “This could have a significant negative impact on military operations, both in peacetime and war. “I, therefore, strongly oppose,” Esper said, adding that the proposed service had “the potential for widespread disruption and degradation of GPS services” that rely on signals from space. Esper’s letter was released Wednesday by the Pentagon, Bloomberg reports, and the FCC is not bound by the recommendation. In April 2019, Brig. Gen. Robert S. Spalding III was interviewed by The New Yorker for an article titled, “The Terrifying Potential of 5G” and again in November by Patrick Bet-David about cybersecurity risks and increased surveillance drastically affecting the American way-of-life: Esper and Spalding are two of many security experts who have warned about cybersecurity risks from 5G (see 1, 2) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology.  Other highly respected individuals and organizations (including the U.S. Navy, NOAA and NASA) have also issued opposition for other safety issues (see 1, 2, 3). American opposition to 5G has been ongoing.  Since 2018 people and animals have been getting sick where 5G has been turned on (see 1, 2, 3, 4).

    {"text": "3.4% Mortality Rate estimate by the World Health Organization (WHO) as of March 3 In his opening remarks at the March 3 media briefing on Covid-19, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated: “Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.” [13] Initial estimate was 2% Initially, the World Health Organization (WHO) had mentioned 2% as a mortality rate estimate in a press conference on Wednesday, January 29 [1][2] and again on February 10. However, on January 29 WHO specified that this was a very early and provisional estimate that might have changed. Surveillance was increasing, within China but also globally, but at the time it was said that: We don’t know how many were infected (“When you look at how many people have died, you need to look at how many people where infected, and right now we don’t know that number. So it is early to put a percentage on that.”[1][2]). The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO. It is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be for the novel coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization [1][2]. Mortality Rate as of Feb. 20 in China (findings from the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission) The Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission published on Feb. 28 by WHO [12] is based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases. The report notes that “The Joint Mission acknowledges the known challenges and biases of reporting crude CFR early in an epidemic” (see also our discussion on: How to calculate the mortality rate during an outbreak). Here are its findings on Case Fatality Ratio, or CFR (the mortality rate): “As of 20 February, 2,114 of the 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases have died (crude fatality ratio [CFR: 3.8%) (note: at least some of whom were identified using a case definition that included pulmonary disease). The overall CFR varies by location and intensity of transmission (i.e. 5.8% in Wuhan vs. 0.7% in other areas in China). In China, the overall CFR was higher in the early stages of the outbreak (17.3% for cases with symptom onset from 1-10 January) and has reduced over time to 0.7% for patients with symptom onset after 1 February. ” [12] The Joint Mission noted that the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak. Mortality Rate, as discussed by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China on Feb. 4 Asked at a press conference on February 4 what the current mortality rate (or case fatality rate, CFR) is, an official with China NHC said that [7]: The formula they are using is: cumulative current total deaths / current confirmed cases. Therefore, as of 24:00 on Feb. 3, the formula used was 425/20,438. Based on this figure, the national mortality rate to date was 2.1% of confirmed cases. There might be mild cases and other cases not reported. 97% of the country’s total deaths (414) were in the Hubei Province. Mortality rate in Wuhan was 4.9%. Mortality rate in the Hubei Province was 3.1%. Mortality rate nationwide was 2.1%. Fatality rate in other provinces was 0.16%. Deaths in Wuhan were 313, accounting for 74% of China’s total. Most of the cases were still mild cases, therefore there was no need to panic. Asked why Wuhan was so much higher than the national level, the NHC official replied that it was for lack of resources, citing as an example that there were only 110 critical care beds in the three designated hospitals where most of the cases were sent. National mortality rate was basically stable, as of Feb. 4 at 2.1%, and it was 2.3% at the beginning of the epidemic, which can be seen as a slight decline. Front the analysis of death cases, it emerged that the demographic profile was mainly male, accounting for 2/3, females accounting for 1/3, and is mainly elderly, more than 80% are elderly over 60 years old, and more than 75% had underlying diseases present such as cardiovascular and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and, in some cases, tumor. Elderly people with basic diseases, as long as they have pneumonia, were clinically a high-risk factor regardless of whether it is a coronavirus or not, and the case fatality rate was also very high, so it is not that the case fatality rate of pneumonia is high because of the infection with the new coronavirus. “This point must be explained to everyone,” concluded the NHC official.[7] Preliminary study providing a tentative 3% estimate for case fatality rate A preliminary study published on The Lancet on January 24 [3] provided an early estimation of 3% for the overall case fatality rate. Below we show an extract (highlights added for the relevant data and observations): Of the 41 patients in this cohort, 22 (55%) developed severe dyspnoea and 13 (32%) required admission to an intensive care unit, and six died. Hence, the case-fatality proportion in this cohort is approximately 14.6%, and the overall case fatality proportion appears to be closer to 3%. However, both of these estimates should be treated with great caution because not all patients have concluded their illness (ie, recovered or died) and the true number of infections and full disease spectrum are unknown. Importantly, in emerging viral infection outbreaks the case-fatality ratio is often overestimated in the early stages because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases. As further data on the spectrum of mild or asymptomatic infection becomes available, one case of which was documented by Chan and colleagues, the case-fatality ratio is likely to decrease. Nevertheless, the 1918 influenza pandemic is estimated to have had a case-fatality ratio of less than 5% but had an enormous impact due to widespread transmission, so there is no room for complacency. A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern – Chen Wang et al., The Lancet. January 24, 2020 Fatality rate can also change as a virus can mutate, according to epidemiologists. Death rate among patients admitted to hospital A study on 138 hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV infection, published on February 7 on JAMA, found that 26% of patients required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 4.3% died, but a number of patients were still hospitalized at the time. [9] A previous study had found that, out of 41 admitted hospital patients, 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.[5] Days from first symptom to death The Wang et al. February 7 study published on JAMA found that the median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days.[9] Previously. the China National Health Commission reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 pm 22 Jan 2020. A study of these cases found that the median days from first symptom to death were 14 (range 6-41) days, and tended to be shorter among people of 70 year old or above (11.5 [range 6-19] days) than those with ages below 70 year old (20 [range 10-41] days.[6] Median Hospital Stay The JANA study found that, among those discharged alive, the median hospital stay was 10 days.[9] Comparison with other viruses For comparison, the case fatality rate with seasonal flu in the United States is less than 0.1% (1 death per every 1,000 cases). Mortality rate for SARS was 10%, and for MERS 34%.", "valid": 2},
